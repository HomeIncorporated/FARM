Here, we report the complete genome analysis results for a new natural recombination nephropathogenic IBV strain named SAIBK, which was isolated in the Sichuan province of China in 2005.\n\nText: tagious and acute disease in domestic chickens, belongs to group III of the genus Coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae (1) . It is an enveloped, unsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus and has a genome of approximately 27.6 kb (2) . Recently, many epidemiological analysis reports have suggested that nephropathogenic IBVs have become increasingly prevalent (3) (4) (5) (6) in China. In this work, the complete genome sequence of an isolate named SAIBK was analyzed and recombination was detected between SAIBK and some previously reported IBVs.\n\nA rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit (TaKaRa, Japan) was used to obtain the 5= and 3= ends of the genome. Other parts were amplified by 19 primers with overlap between each fragment and were cloned into the pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan). All fragments were sequenced three times by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). The sequenced fragments were assembled using the SeqMan software program (DNAStar, Inc.). Sequence alignment was conducted and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the software program MEGA5 (7). Recombination analysis was performed using the RDP 4.14 (8) and SimPlot 3.5.1 (9) software programs.\n\nThe complete genome of the SAIBK strain is 27,534 nucleotides (nt) in length, including the poly(A) tail. It has a classical IBV genome organization with 10 open reading frames (ORFs):\n\nThe genome sequence of SAIBK shows the highest identity (94.3%) to the Chinese IBV strain SC021202 (GenBank accession no. EU714029) and the lowest identity (85.8%) to two Chinese IBV strains, BJ (GenBank accession no. AY319651) and DY07 (GenBank accession no. HM245923). It has lower nucleotide identities of 88.1%, 87.9%, and 87.7% to the most popularly used IBV vaccine strains, H120, H52, and M41, respectively.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the complete genome results indicated that the SAIBK strain clusters into the same branch as the IBV YN strain (GenBank accession no. JF893452) and the SC021202 strain (GenBank accession no. EU714029). The S1 subunit of the IBV genome is the major determinant of serotype (10) (11) (12) (13) , and S1 analysis indicated that the SAIBK strain has a 4/91-like serotype.\n\nThe employed recombination detection methods revealed that SAIBK is a chimera virus, with recombination by the SC021202 strain as a major parent and the H120 vaccine strain as a minor parent. The first and second recombination regions were located at positions 7231 to 9126 and 13437 to 14473 in genes 1a and 1b, respectively. There were two other recombination regions detected at positions 951 to 1067 and 5393 to 5605 of SAIBK, which were recombined with the SC021202 strain as a major parent and the H52 vaccine strain as a minor parent. The recombination detection results suggested that SAIBK is possibly a chimera virus derived from the popularly used vaccine strains H120 and H52 and the field strain SC021202, and the SC021202 strain was isolated from chickens vaccinated with H120 in the Sichuan province of China in 2003 (14) . This result revealed that the field IBVs in Sichuan Province have undergone genetic recombination and are possibly emerging as new mutant strains, such as SAIBK.\n\nNucleotide sequence accession number.

However, the mechanism of transmission from the wastewater of the sink P-trap to patients remains poorly understood. Herein we report the use of a designated hand-washing sink lab gallery to model dispersion of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Escherichia coli from sink wastewater to the surrounding environment. We found no dispersion of GFP-expressing E. coli directly from the P-trap to the sink basin or surrounding countertop with coincident water flow from a faucet. However, when the GFP-expressing E. coli cells were allowed to mature in the P-trap under conditions similar to those in a hospital environment, a GFP-expressing E. coli-containing putative biofilm extended upward over 7 days to reach the strainer. This subsequently resulted in droplet dispersion to the surrounding areas (<30 in.) during faucet operation. We also demonstrated that P-trap colonization could occur by retrograde transmission along a common pipe. We postulate that the organisms mobilize up to the strainer from the P-trap, resulting in droplet dispersion rather than dispersion directly from the P-trap. This work helps to further define the mode of transmission of bacteria from a P-trap reservoir to a vulnerable hospitalized patient. IMPORTANCE Many recent reports demonstrate that sink drain pipes become colonized with highly consequential multidrug-resistant bacteria, which then results in hospital-acquired infections. However, the mechanism of dispersal of bacteria from the sink to patients has not been fully elucidated. Through establishment of a unique sink gallery, this work found that a staged mode of transmission involving biofilm growth from the lower pipe to the sink strainer and subsequent splatter to the bowl and surrounding area occurs rather than splatter directly from the water in the lower pipe. We have also demonstrated that bacterial transmission can occur via connections in wastewater plumbing to neighboring sinks. This work helps to more clearly define the mechanism and risk of transmission from a wastewater source to hospitalized patients in a world with increasingly antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can thrive in wastewater environments and cause infections in vulnerable patients.\n\nText: D espite early reports (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) , the premise that hand-wash sink traps can act as reservoirs of bacteria that cause nosocomial infections has been frequently overlooked. There has recently been an alarming increase in sink-related outbreaks worldwide, with many reports establishing an observational link (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . A sink often operates as an open conduit to wastewater in a patient care area that is often in the same room as the patient.\n\nHealth care establishments often invest in desperate interventions to deal with nosocomial outbreaks. The preferred method for addressing most of the environmentrelated transmission is to employ enhanced cleaning using chemical and physical agents (14, 15) . Unfortunately, routine approaches are inefficient in completely eliminating drug-resistant Gammaproteobacteria in an inaccessible microbiologically active area such as a sink trap (6, (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . The wet, humid, and relatively protected environment in a sink trap favors the formation of rich stable microbial communities (16, 21, 22) . These communities will be exposed to liquids and waste that are discarded in a sink and may include antimicrobials, discarded beverages, soap, presumably pathogenic bacteria from health care workers' hands, and other items. In short, sink traps could serve as a breeding ground for opportunistic and highly antimicrobial-resistant bacteria that cannot be easily cleaned or removed (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) .\n\nThere are many reports of a genetic association between pathogens found in sink traps and those found in patients (29, 30) . However, surprisingly little work has been done to understand the microscale transmission dynamics. It was previously demonstrated using a suspension of fluorescent particles (Glo Germ; Glo Germ Co., Moab, UT) that material injected into the P-trap gets dispersed around a hand-washing sink (6) . This result however has not been replicated hitherto in the follow-up studies. Dispersion has never been investigated with living organisms. Ultimately, many details remain unaddressed surrounding the spread of Enterobacteriaceae in sink-trap wastewater systems: (i) can organisms grow retrograde from the P-trap water to the sink strainer, (ii) can organisms spread from one sink to another along the internal surfaces of pipes with shared drainage systems, and (iii) which portion of a colonized drain pipe results in dispersion into the sink bowl during a hand-washing event? We aim to better understand the dispersion dynamics of Gammaproteobacteria living in the wastewater of a sink strainer and P-trap into an area where patients and health care workers could be exposed. To study this dynamic, we used a surrogate organism that could be easily tracked while remaining in the Enterobacteriaceae family, where some of the most concerning threats in antimicrobial resistance are developing (30) .\n\nGrowth and colonization of GFP-expressing E. coli in the P-trap. In the first 14 days following the installation of the P-trap with established green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Escherichia coli and just water running from the faucet, GFPexpressing E. coli was not detected in the tailpipe beyond 1.5 in. above the liquid level in the P-trap. GFP-expressing E. coli, however, was found to be viable in the P-trap without any nutrients added. A nutrient regimen was then instituted to understand the influence of nutrients on mobility and upward growth. The addition of tryptic soy broth (TSB) promoted GFP-expressing E. coli growth as early as day 1, with growth observed in the tailpipe 2 in. above the liquid surface in the P-trap (Table 1) . On day 7, the strainer (\u03f38 in. above the liquid in the P-trap) was found to be colonized with GFP-expressing E. coli. This translates to an average growth rate of 1 in./day along the length of the tailpipe with the addition of nutrients and without faucet operation. GFP-expressing E. coli was not detected in the faucet water.\n\nSink-to-sink transmission of bacteria. In these experiments, a flanking sink (sink 5) was the only P-trap inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli and therefore was the sole source for transmission to the connected sinks. Starting with a lower inoculum concentration (10 3 CFU/ml) in sink 5, on day 7, GFP-expressing E. coli was detected in the sink 2 and sink 3 P-traps (Fig. 1a) . With inoculum concentrations of 10 6 CFU/ml and \u03fe10 10 CFU/ml in sink 5, all of the sink P-traps in the sink gallery with the exception of sink 1 were found to be colonized with GFP-expressing E. coli after 7 days (Fig. 1b and  c) . Faucet water and aerators tested negative for GFP-expressing E. coli. Irrespective of the starting inoculum concentration, on day 7 the highest level of colonization was recorded in the sink 3 P-trap. After day 7, when the nutrient regimen (described previously) was followed for an additional 7 days in each of the sinks in the sink gallery with an inoculum concentration of \u03fe10 10 CFU/ml, GFP-expressing E. coli was detected in the strainers of sinks 2 and 3 on day 14. This finding validated the upward growth and growth rate in the tailpipe when nutrients were added. Nonfluorescent colonies were occasionally observed in the P-trap water samples collected from the sinks, which were subsequently identified to be Pseudomonas sp. or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and fluorescent colonies were confirmed to be E. coli.\n\nDispersion of microspheres from sinks. In the first dispersion experiment, when fluorescent microspheres were inoculated into the offset drain tailpiece only 4 in. below the strainer, no microspheres were detected on the polyester sheets placed on the counter space.\n\nHowever, when the sink bowl was coated with the microspheres, polyester sheets overlaid on the counter space captured the dispersed microspheres caused by the faucet operation. Dispersion was observed on almost all zones of the sink counter space (Fig. 2) . Relatively higher levels of dispersion were observed along the major and minor axes of the elliptical sink bowl (zones 2, 5, 6, 9, 11, and 12) . Anterior corners of the sink counter space (zones 4 and 7), which were most distant from the impact of water in the sink bowl, received the lowest dispersion.\n\nDispersion of GFP-expressing E. coli from sinks. Initially the P-trap alone was inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli and carefully installed, keeping the tailpipe and strainer free of GFP-expressing E. coli before operating the faucets. No fluorescent CFU were observed on the plates placed on the counter or attached to the bowl surface after faucet operation. Similarly, no fluorescent CFU were detected when GFPexpressing E. coli was inoculated into the offset drain tailpiece only 4 in. below the strainer. Interestingly, when there was conspicuous water backup over the strainer as a result of a higher water flow rate from the faucet than the drainage rate from the P-trap, dispersal was detected on the plates attached to the bowl surface.\n\nThe dispersion pattern recorded when the sink bowl was coated with GFPexpressing E. coli was comparable to the pattern recorded when the sink bowl was coated with fluorescent microspheres (Fig. 2) . Dispersion was significantly higher along the axes (zones 6, 9, 11, and 12) and lower at the corners of the sink counter space (zones 4, 7, and 10).\n\nIn contrast, dispersion of GFP-expressing E. coli caused by the faucet operation was much more extensive when the strainer was allowed to be colonized with GFPexpressing E. coli prior to the dispersion experiment. In addition to the sink counter space, we measured dispersion to the sink bowl, faucet, faucet handles, splatter shields, and the extended counter surface. Dispersion of GFP-expressing E. coli was highest on the plates attached to the sink bowl (Fig. 3b) . Further, dispersion was greater along the \n\n\u03ea\" and \"\u03e9\" denote the absence and presence of GFP-expressing E. coli, respectively.\n\nminor axis of the sink bowl (Fig. 3b , zones B3, B4, and B10) than along the major axis of the sink bowl, associated with a shorter distance from the strike point of the faucet water to the bowl along this axis. The next highest CFU count from the dispersal was recorded on the counter area near the faucets (Fig. 3a , zones 12 and 11). A similar pattern of higher dispersion near the faucets and lower dispersion at the corners of the counter space (Fig. 3a , zones 4, 7, and 10) was also observed using microspheres. Dispersion was also recorded in other zones of the counter space, on the Plexiglas splatter shields, faucets, faucet handles, and extended surface (Fig. 3c ). There were no GFP-expressing E. coli CFU recorded on plates placed beyond 30 in. from the strainer, demarcating the range of dispersion under these experimental conditions. Table 2 gives a summary of the total distribution loads recorded using fluorescent microspheres and GFP-expressing E. coli across each experiment. The loads of dispersion on the sink counter were comparable when the sink bowl was coated with microspheres or GFP-expressing E. coli before the faucet operation. Although the dispersion load on the sink counter was lower when the sink strainer was colonized, it is interesting to note that the sink bowl received the highest dispersion.\n\nTo mimic dispersion in a hospital setting, we first investigated whether GFPexpressing E. coli would establish consistent colonization in a sink trap as many other Gammaproteobacteria implicated in nosocomial outbreaks have done (6, 28) . Many recent reports demonstrate that P-traps become colonized with highly consequential Gammaproteobacteria, which then results in nosocomial transmission (29, 31, 32) . The retained water in a sink P-trap is present to provide a water barrier to prevent off-gassing of sewer smell, but it may inadvertently provide favorable conditions for pathogenic and opportunistic antibiotic-resistant microorganisms to survive and develop resilient biofilms (3, 33) . However, the mechanism of dispersal of the bacteria in the P-trap to patients or the surrounding health care area had not been fully elucidated. We began with the hypothesis that the bacteria originate from the P-trap via droplet creation when the water from the faucet hits the P-trap water, thus contaminating the sink bowl and the surrounding area. The finding supporting this theory had been previously reported using Glo Germ particles (6) . However, in the present study with careful attention to avoid strainer and tail piece contamination, the dispersal directly from the sink P-trap with either microspheres or GFP-expressing E. coli could not be reproduced as previously reported (6) .\n\nRather this work demonstrates a different, more staged mode of transmission from a P-trap reservoir to the sink and surrounding environment. GFP-expressing E. coli in the P-trap alone was sustained for 14 days but did not grow or mobilize up the tailpipe to the strainer with just intermittent water exposure. However, when nutrients were subsequently added to the system, the organisms rapidly grew up the tailpipe to the strainer at approximately an inch per day. In a real-world setting, motility of bacteria inside the tailpipe is restricted to relatively sporadic and brief wetting events in which swimming is an opportunity to colonize new surfaces. It is assumed that once established, the biofilm promotes the upward growth of GFP-expressing E. coli in the tailpipe at an accelerated rate. The nutrient regimen that promoted colonization in our model reflects our and others' observations of items commonly disposed of in hospital sinks (intravenous fluids, feeding supplements, and leftover beverages) (5, 32) .\n\nTransmission of bacteria between sinks via a common pipe was a key finding in this study as this highlights the concept that premise plumbing may be a more continuous system with shared microbiology than a single isolated sink. The sink gallery used in this study provided a unique in situ advantage to investigate sink-to-sink transmission of bacteria through common drains. The two possible mechanisms for P-trap strainers becoming colonized are seeding of organisms from above and retrograde spread of organisms along common pipes in a hospital wastewater infrastructure. Here we demonstrate that it is possible for GFP-expressing E. coli to contaminate adjacent P-traps with just time and water given a standard U.S. code piping rise of 0.25 ft/ft. Sink-to-sink or retrograde transmission may explain the recurrence of pathogen colonization following intervention strategies like disinfection or replacement of plumbing (23) . Sink 3 was lowest on the slope in the drain line (see Fig. 4 ) with arguably the most opportunity for reflux and retrograde wetting. Sink 1, on the other hand, was farthest away from the source (sink 5), and its P-trap had the greatest incline in the drain line connecting the sinks, which could perhaps contribute to the reasons there was no GFP-expressing E. coli colonization detected in it after 7 days. There has been more investigation about microbiologic dynamics of infectious viral particles such as those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Ebola viruses through premise plumbing systems (34) (35) (36) . However, the microbiology, sustainability, and dynamics might be very different, although the backflow and inoculation issues could have some parallels when comparing viruses to bacteria. As Enterobacteriaceae can either multiply or remain viable for long periods of time in biofilms coating the interior of P-traps and the connected plumbing, it may not be sustainable to target any intervention limited to a single isolated sink as a source of a particular pathogen.\n\nData from different dispersal experiments suggest that although P-traps can act as the source or the reservoir of pathogens, the physical presence of the organism in the sink bowl or colonization of the strainer is necessary for the dispersal to occur. Colonization of strainers or drains reported in earlier studies (7, 10, 13, 24, 37) was perhaps a result of ascending biofilm growth from the P-trap to the strainer or introduction through contaminated fluids. Many of the studies used swab samples, which likely sampled the strainer rather than P-trap water (17, 20) . Once the strainer was colonized, the water from the faucet resulted in GFP-expressing E. coli dispersion in the bowl and to the surrounding surfaces of up to 30 in. The range of dispersal (6) . Greater dispersal near the faucet may be attributed to the specific designs of the sink bowl and faucet in this study, which determine the contact angle of water impact. This is an important finding since many sinks in hospitals are similar in design, with faucet handles representing a high-touch surface for the sink users (38) . It can also be concluded from the dispersion experiments that secondary and successive dispersals would likely increase the degree and the scope of dispersion. There are several limitations to this work. First the use of similar sink bowls across these sinks only examines the dispersion pattern of this particular sink design. Similarly the sink-to-sink transmission may not be applicable to all wastewater plumbing systems as the fixtures on the pipe are very close together, unlike most layouts in health care settings. However, we speculate that transmission could occur on larger systems over greater time scales, especially if heavy nutrient and contamination loads were also included. GFP-expressing E. coli is a laboratory surrogate, and the putative biofilms established in the short time frame of our experiments are unlikely to be as complex or stable as biofilms developed in a hospital wastewater system over many years. However, to address the monomicrobial dominance of the GFP-expressing E. coli added to the system, we kept the system open, and other environmental organisms were able to cocolonize in an attempt to mimic the hospital system. Another limitation was the need to add nutrients to the drain to ensure rapid and robust colonization. We are not clear how widespread the practice of disposing of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids or leftover beverages in the hand-wash sinks is; however, we have observed this practice, and anecdotally it appears to be relatively common in the United States. We also did not completely characterize the droplet sizes, nor do we demonstrate air sampling to understand if the dispersion is only droplet or if there are also aerosols that contain GFP-expressing E. coli. This would require additional testing and is planned as future work.\n\nIn summary, this work for the first time better models the mechanisms of spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens arising from the sink drain and infecting patients. Droplet dispersion from the P-trap does not happen directly. Rather it is a multistage process: dispersal originates from the strainer and/or the bowl after growth of the biofilm up from the microbial reservoir of the P-trap. We also demonstrate sink-to-sink transmission via a common sanitary pipe. This work could have implications for patient safety, infection control, and interventions as well as the design of future hospital plumbing systems to eliminate this mode of transmission to vulnerable hospitalized patients.\n\nSink gallery design. A dedicated sink gallery was set up to simulate hospital hand-washing sinks. The gallery was comprised of five sink modules assembled next to each other (Fig. 4) . The five hand-wash sink stations were identical in bowl designs and dimensions and were modeled from the most common intensive care unit hand-washing sink type in the acute care hospital at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Partitions made of 24-in.-high Plexiglas sheet were installed between the sinks to prevent splatter and cross contamination. Each sink module was built with Corian integrated sink/countertops without an overflow and fitted with an 8-in. centerset 2-handle gooseneck faucet (Elkay, Oak Brook, IL). The drain line (Dearborn Brass-Oatey, Cleveland, OH). All of the fixtures were made of brass with chrome plating. Each of the sink P-traps was connected to a 3-in. common cast-iron pipe sloping into a T-joint leading into the building sanitary line located behind sink 3 (Fig. 4) .\n\nInoculation, growth, and establishment of GFP-expressing E. coli in sink P-traps. For the GFP-expressing E. coli strain (ATCC 25922GFP), the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is contained on a plasmid that also contains an ampicillin resistance gene. A single isolated colony of GFP-expressing E. coli grown from a \u03ea80\u00b0C stock was inoculated into 5 ml tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) containing 100 g/ml ampicillin (ATCC medium 2855). The inoculum concentration and method varied for each experiment. For establishment of GFP-expressing E. coli in sink P-traps, new autoclaved P-traps were filled with 100 ml 0.1\u03eb TSB and inoculated with \u03f310 3 CFU/ml GFPexpressing E. coli. Following inoculation, both ends of the P-traps were covered with perforated Parafilm (Bemis, Inc., Oshkosh, WI) and allowed to incubate at room temperature (22 \u03ee 2\u00b0C) for 14 days to facilitate adherent bacterial growth. The medium in the P-trap was decanted and replaced with fresh 0.1\u03eb TSB every 48 h. An aliquot of decanted medium and a swab sample from the inner surface of the P-trap were plated on tryptic soy agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) plates containing 100 g/ml ampicillin (TSA) to monitor the growth of GFP-expressing E. coli in the P-traps. TSA plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, and CFU fluorescing under UV light were enumerated. All preparatory culturing of GFP-expressing E. coli took place in a separate room from the sink gallery to avoid unintentional contamination.\n\nInstallation of P-traps colonized with GFP-expressing E.coli. After the 14-day incubation, P-traps were fastened into the plumbing of the sinks (Fig. 5a) . The remainder of the drain line was either autoclaved (strainer, tailpipe, and trap arms) prior to installation or surface disinfected (sink bowl, countertop, and faucets) with Caviwipes-1 (Meterx Research, Romulus, MI), maintaining at least 1 min of contact time. After the P-trap was installed, a daily regimen was followed in which 25 ml of TSB followed by 25 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution (saline) were added in the ratio 1:3 via the strainer (Fig. 5b) to mimic the potential nutrient exposure in the hospital.\n\nSampling and enumeration of GFP-expressing E. coli. To monitor the growth of GFP-expressing E. coli in the plumbing, sampling ports were drilled along the length of the tailpiece (between the P-trap and the strainer) and the trap arm (between the P-trap and the common line). These holes were fitted with size 00 silicone stoppers (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) (Fig. 5a) . Sterile cotton swabs (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) presoaked in saline were inserted through these sampling ports, and samples were collected by turning the swab in a circular motion on the inner surface (\u03f320 cm 2 ) of the tailpipes. Sample swabs were pulse-vortexed in 3 ml saline, and serial dilutions were plated on TSA. The strainer, faucet aerator, and bowl surface were sampled with presoaked swabs and processed as described earlier.\n\nSink-to-sink transmission of bacteria. To investigate sink-to-sink transmission of bacteria, a distal sink (sink 5) (Fig. 4) was fitted with a P-trap inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli. The effects of different inoculum concentrations of GFP-expressing E. coli-10 3 , 10 6 , and \u03fe10 10 CFU/ml (colonized for 14 days)-were investigated. Identification to the species level of fluorescent and nonfluorescent colonies identified from mixed pipe cultures was performed using a matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI)-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Vitek-MS; bioM\u00e9rieux, Durham, NC). The wastewater paths of sinks 1 to 4 were either autoclaved (strainer, tailpipe, P-traps, and trap arms) prior to installation or surface disinfected (sink bowl, countertop, and faucets) with Caviwipes-1 (Meterx Research, Romulus, MI). Faucets on each of the five sinks were turned on simultaneously for 1 min, supplying water at a flow rate of 8 liters/min, once every 24 h for 7 days. No additional feed to any of the sinks was added during this period of 7 days. On days 0 and 7, P-traps on each of the five sinks were unfastened, and swab samples from the P-trap were collected and processed as described earlier.\n\nDispersion measured using fluorescent microspheres. Fluoresbrite YO carboxylate microspheres (Polysciences, Inc.) which had a 1-m diameter and maximum excitation and emission of 529 nm and 546 nm, respectively, were used as a tracer in the preliminary experiments to understand droplet dispersion from the hand-wash sinks.\n\nTo test whether microspheres could be dispersed from below the sink strainer, a 1-ml suspension of microspheres (\u03f310 10 particles) was injected through a strainer attached to a Hert 4.5-in. offset drain tailpiece typically used for wheelchair-accessible sinks (American Standard, model 7723018.002) (Fig. 5c) . The vertical distance between the strainer and microsphere suspension injected into the tailpipe was \u03f34 in. Counter space around the sink bowl was thoroughly wiped with alcohol wipes (Covidien Webcol 6818; Kendall), and polyester sheets precut to appropriate shapes were placed on the counter to cover the entire sink counter and labeled according to position (Fig. 6a) . The faucet was turned on for 5 min at a water flow rate of 1.8 to 3.0 liters/min. Polyester sheets were harvested and immediately analyzed using a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) with an exposure time of 5 s. Fluorescent microspheres were enumerated from the digital micrographs using the Image Lab Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.).\n\nTo test whether microspheres could be dispersed from the surface of the sink bowl, the sink bowl was evenly coated with a 20-ml microsphere suspension (\u03f310 10 particles/ml) using a disposable swab (Sage Products, Inc., Cary, IL), and the dispersion experiment was repeated following the protocol described above. To ascertain there was no nonspecific background fluorescence in the sink and/or the water from the faucet, a control using the same protocol but without the fluorescent microspheres was performed before each experiment. Dispersion measured using GFP-expressing E.coli. Dispersion using GFP-expressing E. coli was investigated in three experiments. To test whether live organisms in the P-trap could be dispersed by running water, \u03f310 10 CFU/ml GFP-expressing E. coli in saline was added to an autoclaved P-trap and fitted into the drain line that was preautoclaved (strainer, tailpipe, and trap arms). Similarly, to test whether live organisms could be dispersed from the tailpieces of wheelchair-accessible sinks, a suspension of \u03f310 10 CFU/ml GFP-expressing E. coli was added with a syringe through the strainer into the Hert 4.5-ft offset drain tailpiece (Fig. 5c ). Just as in the microsphere dispersion experiment, the vertical distance between the strainer and GFP-expressing E. coli suspension injected into the tailpipe was \u03f34 in.\n\nWe next tested whether live organisms from the surface of the sink bowl could be dispersed by running water. The sink bowl surface was evenly coated with an approximately 20-ml suspension of 10 10 CFU/ml GFP-expressing E. coli.\n\nFinally, to mimic all of these conditions, a P-trap colonized with GFP-expressing E. coli (for 14 days) was installed, and a nutrient regimen (Fig. 5b) was followed for 14 days to intentionally promote the GFP-expressing E. coli colonization in the attached tailpipe and strainer. On day 15, the dispersion experiment was performed.\n\nBefore each of the GFP-expressing E. coli dispersion experiments, the counter space was thoroughly disinfected with Caviwipes-1. TSA plates were then positioned on the sink counter surrounding the bowl and an extension platform (Fig. 6b) . Additional plates were attached to the sink bowl, faucets, Plexiglas partitions, and faucet handles using adhesive tape. TSA plates were also placed 3 m away from the sink as negative controls. The faucet was turned on for 5 min with a water flow rate of 1.8 to 3.0 liters/min. Lids of the TSA plates were removed only during faucet operation. Swab samples from the faucet aerators before and after operation were collected and plated on TSA. Prior to each dispersion experiment, 50 ml water from the faucet was also collected, and aliquots were plated to assess for the presence of GFP-expressing E. coli in source water and ensure cross contamination of GFP-expressing E. coli had not occurred. A control dispersion experiment was also performed using the same protocol prior to GFP-expressing E. coli inoculation in each case. Dispersion per defined area (CFU per square centimeter) was deduced by dividing the CFU counts in the TSA plate by the surface area of the TSA plate.", "document_id": 2585}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When was the  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus isolated first?", "id": 557, "answers": [{"text": "(MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012, in a 60-year-old man who died in Jeddah, KSA due to severe acute pneumonia and multiple organ failure", "answer_start": 2273}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the Case fatality rate for MERS Coronavirus?", "id": 558, "answers": [{"text": "Recent fatality rate (CFR) of 21%", "answer_start": 2686}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How does gender influence MERS-COV infection?", "id": 559, "answers": [{"text": " MERS-CoV infects males more than females", "answer_start": 2869}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which is the source animal for the MERS-COV?", "id": 560, "answers": [{"text": "Dromedary camels are the major animal source of MERS-CoV transmission to humans.", "answer_start": 3322}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the median time until death in MERS-COV?", "id": 562, "answers": [{"text": "median time until death is 11-13 days (range 5-27 days) among severely ill patients", "answer_start": 3925}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the incubation period for MERS-COV?", "id": 563, "answers": [{"text": " incubation period of 16 days with a mean of 5-6 days [", "answer_start": 3850}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the treatment for MERS-COV?", "id": 564, "answers": [{"text": "ere is no specific treatment for MERS-CoV.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. METHODS: It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. These confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD \u00b1 22.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of Saudi Arabia as well and explore potential preventable risk factors.\n\nText: A respiratory viral disease caused by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012, in a 60-year-old man who died in Jeddah, KSA due to severe acute pneumonia and multiple organ failure [1] . Since then, 27 countries have reported the presence of this virus, including the 12 countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region. Several outbreaks have occurred in multiple countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea [2] . Recent fatality rate (CFR) of 21% [5, 6] . Very limited evidence is available for exploring the epidemiology of this virus among the pediatric population [7] . e literature shows that MERS-CoV infects males more than females [8, 9] . e casefatality rate of men (52%) is higher than that of women (23%) [10] . Males with a history of serious medical conditions are highly susceptible to this infection. Moreover, the mean age of infection in adults is 60 years [10] . e mode of transmission is not entirely understood yet [2] ; however, human-to-human [11] and zoonotic sources of transmission [12] have been documented in many studies. Dromedary camels are the major animal source of MERS-CoV transmission to humans. Interhuman transmission of the virus did not occur easily, but it is seen mainly in patients' families and healthcare settings [2] . Clinical pictures of this infection varied from asymptomatic to mild respiratory symptoms to severe respiratory distress and death [2] . Severe ailment can often cause respiratory catastrophes that need mechanical ventilation and support in ICUs across different healthcare settings [4] . Studies have suggested an incubation period of 16 days with a mean of 5-6 days [12, 13] , while the median time until death is 11-13 days (range 5-27 days) among severely ill patients [13] . e gold standard test for the detection of this virus is real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays [14] .\n\nere is no specific treatment for MERS-CoV. Like most viral infections, the treatment options are supportive and symptomatic [2] . At present, no vaccine exists for preventing the infections of MERS-CoV. e CDC indicated that preventative actions should be taken for any type of respiratory illness [4] . Such actions include washing hands with water and soap for around 20 seconds or using hand sanitizers with alcohol if no water is available. One must cover their nose and mouth during instances of sneezing and coughing with a tissue and avoid touching the mouth, nose, or eyes with their hands until washed properly. Repeatedly touched surfaces, such as door knobs, should be disinfected and cleaned regularly. Intimate personal contact, e.g., kissing, and sharing cups or eating utensils must also be avoided [15] .\n\nMany studies have been conducted in recent years in Saudi Arabia to combat this deadly disease. A large multicentre study showed that it is nearly impossible to differentiate between patients of MERS-CoV and non-MERS-CoV just on the basis of clinical presentation [16] . Another cohort study, which was hospital-based (17 cases vs. 82 controls), found that there were statistically significant differences in terms of gender, clinical, and radiographic presentations [17] . Similarly, two more single-centre case control studies reported that the presenting symptoms of MERS-CoV infection were not specific [18, 19] .\n\nPhysicians and public health practitioners need to identify suspected cases which have higher chances of diagnosis as confirmed cases prior to laboratory testing (which usually takes between 12 and 24 hours). Identification of a confirmed case is necessary to implement preventive strategies to combat the spread of the disease to family members and hospital healthcare workers [20] . Mild symptomatic cases, which result in a positive PCR, may be isolated at home. Severe to moderate cases should be admitted to and isolated in a hospital until they improve and then be discharged for isolation at home for an extended period. Both mild and severe cases are retested after 7 days, and the test is subsequently repeated after every 3 days until a negative result is obtained [20] .\n\nIdentifying suspected cases which may have higher chances of getting diagnosed as a confirmed case and implementing strict procedures on them might offer the best solution.\n\ne challenge is to flag these patients by some demographic markers, as the clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infected patients were non-specific. erefore, we aimed to identify some demographic markers specific to confirmed cases of MERS-CoV. e nature of these markers has not been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence this study aims to identify them.\n\nA cross-sectional study was conducted at the regional laboratory and blood bank, located at Shumaisi Hospital in Riyadh, KSA. e laboratory has received the Central Blood Banks and Reference Laboratories Accreditation Program Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institution (CBAHI) 2018 [21] .\n\nTechnique. Data were collected during the period of January 2017 to December 2017. All patients in Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions who had their samples tested at Riyadh regional lab during the study period were considered as suspected cases.\n\ne study had two aims: descriptive and analytical. For the descriptive aim, we estimated the prevalence of MERS-CoV. For the analytical aim, a binary logistic regression model was developed. In this model, we included the risk factors of gender, age, seasons, nationality, healthcare status (yes/no), hospitals, and area of residence. Data were cross-checked with a labcomputerized database. Further data were collected on demographic characteristics (age and sex), underlying nationality, and health care status.\n\nWe collected data from 25,400 cases, of which 23,646 suspected cases of MERS-CoV were included in the final analysis. Data were cleaned, entered, stored, and managed with an excel database and IBM SPSS Version 25. e statistical analyses consisted of descriptive counts and percentages. For those continuously scaled items, nonparametric statistics (medians, interquartile ranges, minimum, and maximum) were used to describe the distribution. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of confirmation of infection within the suspected cases groups. At first, univariate analyses were conducted to estimate the unadjusted contribution and to determine the significant risk factors. is was followed by a multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the independent contribution of each covariate. To determine significant factors, a p value below 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval were considered. \n\nA confirmed case is defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection [20] . \n\nA total of 23,646 of MERS-CoV suspected cases were included in this study, of which 52.3% were males (n \ufffd 12376) and 47.7% were females (n \ufffd 11270). e age of individuals with suspected cases ranged between 0 to 92 years with a mean age of 43. 23 e adjusted odds of MERS-CoV remained significant among different age groups; the odds of patients aged between 20-40 years increased threefold (A.OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 1.104-8.76, P value \ufffd 0.032), whereas in the age group of 41-60 years, it increased further to a risk that was six times higher \n\nis cross-sectional study about the epidemiological analysis of MERS-CoV infection laboratory-based data was conducted in Riyadh over a one-year period (2017). A total of 23,646 suspected cases were included in the results. Of the total suspected cases, 119 cases had been confirmed via laboratory results. All the confirmed cases are reported to MOH through HESN (health electronic surveillance networks) and to the World Health Organization (WHO) through the International Health Regulations (IHR), National Focal Point of Saudi Arabia. We found that MERS-CoV infection was found significantly in people aged between 41 and 60 years and was reported most commonly during the summer season. e odds of infection among males were found to be twice as high as that of females with suspected cases.\n\nDuring the study period, i.e., the year 2017, only 119 confirmed cases were reported, which means that the number of MERS-CoV infection cases has decreased in Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions in comparison to that of the last three years. From 2015 to 2016, there was a 25.4% decrease, whereas from 2016 to 2017, it decreased by 48.7%, which translates into a 50% decrease between the two periods. is also complements the findings reported by of Da'ar and Ahmed in their paper [23] . e predominance of infection in males was also observed in another study pwefromed in KSA (2015), which reported the percentage of confirmed cases among males to be 66%, compared with 34% among females [24] .\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia defines age categories differently from the WHO (children: 0-14, adult: otherwise) [20] . However, unlike the classification used in Saudi Arabia, we have followed the WHO categorization of age to differentiate between children/adolescents (0 to 19 years) and adults (20 years and older) as indicated in WHO reports for age-standardized population and in infectious diseases [25] . is categorization was also followed by Aly and his collaborators in their recent paper published in 2017 [14] . Adults were further subcategorized into three groups according to the age distribution of the study population using the following two cutoff points (age of 41 and age of 60) [14] .\n\nese data agreed with a previous surveillance study, which stated that the majority of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported among people aged 40 and above [24] . In 2016, only 9 of 552 cases (1.6%) of MERS-CoV infection were found among pediatric patients. Moreover, the study which was conducted in King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh (KFMC) between January 2012 and December 2013 did not report any MERS-CoV cases among children [26] . e study which was conducted across the Gulf countries for four years by Mahmoud Aly et al. between 2012 and 2016 suggests that the prevalence and distribution of MERS-CoV were the highest-risk in elderly aged 60 years or above [14] . Similar to our results, this study also reported the highest number of confirmed cases during the summer season [14] .\n\nAmong confirmed cases, only 25.2% were healthcare workers, whereas around 75% were non-healthcare workers.\n\nis is in agreement with the study done by Ahmad to estimate the survival rate in MERS-CoV globally prior to 26 January 2017; 86.9% were not health-care workers compared with 13.1% confirmed cases of healthcare workers [27] . Similarly, other studies also reported a lower prevalence in healthcare workers [28] [29] [30] .\n\nOur data reported a higher prevalence of infection among Saudi nationals as compared with non-Saudi. Another study also showed similar results but with a much higher percentage among Saudis, which may be due to the fact that it included Saudis from all regions [29] . ere is no finding basis for comparison as such, because our study was focused on the Riyadh and Al Qassim regions only.\n\nIn our study, we detected a low prevalence (0.5%). e low positive predictive value of our lab results is not related to the low sensitivity and specificity of the lab assay. e estimated analytical sensitivity and specificity of the Real Star kit from Altona was reported to be 100% with no cross reactivity with other respiratory pathogens [31] . Moreover, this low predictive value in the lab results is related to the high burden of false positive cases referred to the lab. In fact, this research is just the starting point to shed the light on more factors that might help in putting more descriptive criteria to lower the financial and human resources burden.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no one has developed a logistic regression that focuses on demographic risk factors such as sex, age, and seasons prior to our study. However, it is worth mentioning that Ahmed et al. developed a risk prediction model that encompasses risk factors such as chest pain, leukopenia, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [21] . However, further investigations are needed to confirm our findings.\n\nOne of the major strengths of our study is that it is a comprehensive regional study which included all the suspected cases of MERS-CoV in the Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions. Secondly, the external validity of our study is also expected to be high, as it covers the two regions completely, meaning that the records of all suspected cases in these two main regions in Saudi Arabia were included. irdly, the quality of the data is considered to be high, given that the contagious and life-threatening nature of this disease has led to strict obedience to rules which are enforced in a timely manner, thus ensuring accurate reporting of suspected cases. In addition to this, quality assurance policies are implemented at HESN in order to maintain the highest level of validity and reliability of the data collection process. e variables available for suspected cases were limited to demographics, which limited the scope of our research, but they provided valuable information to form a basis for future studies of a broader scope. Variables such as primary/secondary infections are vital pieces of information, but due the limitation of the data available, we could not determine their effects.\n\nAccording to our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that have specifically investigated MERS-CoV risk factors in the Riyadh and Al-Qassim areas (two major regions in KSA). Given that all suspected and confirmed cases were included in this study, we assume that our results are generalizable for both the regions with confidence. It must be noted that the comparative group of this study is different from that of the previous ones, as we compared those with confirmed MERS-CoV with those with suspected MERS-CoV who have passed all stages of screening at the hospital, whereas other studies were hospital but not lab-based with an aim of identifying factors that help in suspecting rather than confirming cases. is might be the reason why we have found some significant demographic factors unlike other reports.\n\nIn conclusion, this research is about predictors for the confirmation of diagnosis among suspected cases only, meaning that the factors we found can help in identifying suspected cases that may have a higher chance of testing positive. is will help primary healthcare professionals to develop a better screening tool for suspected cases, as currently only a small minority of suspected cases are confirmed positive via lab results, consequently resulting in a lot of resources being spent to test thousands of samples, just for the identification of a few cases. e three factors we identified are important because, for example, a female, aged 18, presenting in winter will be less likely to be diagnosed than a male, aged 45, presenting in the summer, or, to give another example, a 60-year-old male who is presenting MERS-CoV signs with a negative lab result may need retesting.\n\nOur study covered two main regions in Saudi Arabia and provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in these two regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for prevention and management of such contagious diseases. Our results showed that only a minority of suspected cases are actually diagnosed with the disease, meaning that the procedures being implemented seemed to be highly sensitive but not highly specific. e majority of confirmed cases were male, aged 41 to 60 years, and presented to healthcare facilities in the summer. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions in Saudi Arabia, to explore potential preventable risk factors and go deeper to know the underlying factors that make male aged 41-60 more susceptible than others.\n\ne laboratory data used to support the findings of this study were provided by Riyadh Regional Laboratory under license and are not freely available.

Recent researches revealed that it, as one number of the Caliciviridae, has some specialties in its genome, its reproduction and so on. RESULTS: In this report, we firstly analyzed its genome and two open reading frameworks (ORFs) from this aspect of codon usage bias. Our researches indicated that mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important determinant in RHDV with high codon bias, and the codon usage bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and ORF2, which is maybe one of factors regulating the expression of VP60 (encoding by ORF1) and VP10 (encoding by ORF2). Furthermore, negative selective constraints on the RHDV whole genome implied that VP10 played an important role in RHDV lifecycle. CONCLUSIONS: We conjectured that VP10 might be beneficial for the replication, release or both of virus by inducing infected cell apoptosis initiate by RHDV. According to the results of the principal component analysis for ORF2 of RSCU, we firstly separated 30 RHDV into two genotypes, and the ENC values indicated ORF1 and ORF2 were independent among the evolution of RHDV.\n\nText: Synonymous codons are not used randomly [1] . The variation of codon usage among ORFs in different organisms is accounted by mutational pressure and translational selection as two main factors [2, 3] . Levels and causes of codon usage bias are available to understand viral evolution and the interplay between viruses and the immune response [4] . Thus, many organisms such as bacteria, yeast, Drosophila, and mammals, have been studied in great detail up on codon usage bias and nucleotide composition [5] . However, same researches in viruses, especially in animal viruses, have been less studied. It has been observed that codon usage bias in human RNA viruses is related to mutational pressure, G +C content, the segmented nature of the genome and the route of transmission of the virus [6] . For some vertebrate DNA viruses, genome-wide mutational pressure is regarded as the main determinant of codon usage rather than natural selection for specific coding triplets [4] . Analysis of the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) late genes has revealed a relationship between codon usage and tRNA availability [7] . In the mammalian papillomaviruses, it has been proposed that differences from the average codon usage frequencies in the host genome strongly influence both viral replication and gene expression [8] . Codon usage may play a key role in regulating latent versus productive infection in Epstein-Barr virus [9] . Recently, it was reported that codon usage is an important driving force in the evolution of astroviruses and small DNA viruses [10, 11] . Clearly, studies of synonymous codon usage in viruses can reveal much about the molecular evolution of viruses or individual genes. Such information would be relevant in understanding the regulation of viral gene expression.\n\nUp to now, little codon usage analysis has been performed on Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), which is the pathogen causing Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), also known as rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD) or viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD), a highly infectious and often fatal disease that affects wild and domestic rabbits. Although the virus infects only rabbits, RHD continues to cause serious problems in different parts of the world. RHDV is a single positive stranded RNA virus without envelope, which contains two open reading frames (ORFs) separately encoding a predicted polyprotein and a minor structural protein named VP10 [12] . After the hydrolysis of self-coding 3C-like cysteinase, the polyprotein was finally hydrolyzed into 8 cleavage products including 7 nonstructural proteins and 1 structural protein named as VP60 [13, 14] . Studies on the phylogenetic relationship of RHDVs showed only one serotype had been isolated, and no genotyping for RHDV was reported. It reported that the VP10 was translated with an efficiency of 20% of the preceding ORF1 [15] . In order to better understand the characteristics of the RHDV genome and to reveal more information about the viral genome, we have analyzed the codon usage and dinucleotide composition. In this report, we sought to address the following issues concerning codon usage in RHDV: (i) the extent and causes of codon bias in RHDV; (ii) A possible genotyping of RHDV; (iii) Codon usage bias as a factor reducing the expression of VP10 and (iiii) the evolution of the ORFs.\n\nThe 30 available complete RNA sequences of RHDV were obtained from GenBank randomly in January 2011. The serial number (SN), collection dates, isolated areas and GenBank accession numbers are listed in Table 1 .\n\nTo investigate the characteristics of synonymous codon usage without the influence of amino acid composition, RSCU values of each codon in a ORF of RHDV were calculated according to previous reports (2 Sharp, Tuohy et al. 1986 ) as the followed formula:\n\nWhere g ij is the observed number of the ith codon for jth amino acid which has n i type of synonymous codons. The codons with RSCU value higher than 1.0 have positive codon usage bias, while codons with value lower than 1.0 has relative negative codon usage bias. As RSCU values of some codons are nearly equal to 1.0, it means that these codons are chosen equally and randomly.\n\nThe index GC3s means the fraction of the nucleotides G+C at the synonymous third codon position, excluding Met, Trp, and the termination codons.\n\nThe ENC, as the best estimator of absolute synonymous codon usage bias [16] , was calculated for the quantification of the codon usage bias of each ORF [17] . The predicted values of ENC were calculated as ENC = 2 + s + 29\n\nwhere s represents the given (G+C) 3 % value. The values of ENC can also be obtained by EMBOSS CHIPS program [18] . \n\nAnalyses were conducted with the Nei-Gojobori model [19] , involving 30 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The values of dn, ds and \u03c9 (dn/ds) were calculated in MEGA4.0 [20] .\n\nMultivariate statistical analysis can be used to explore the relationships between variables and samples. In this study, correspondence analysis was used to investigate the major trend in codon usage variation among ORFs. In this study, the complete coding region of each ORF was represented as a 59 dimensional vector, and each dimension corresponds to the RSCU value of one sense codon (excluding Met, Trp, and the termination codons) [21] .\n\nCorrelation analysis was used to identify the relationship between nucleotide composition and synonymous codon usage pattern [22] . This analysis was implemented based on the Spearman's rank correlation analysis way. All statistical processes were carried out by with statistical software SPSS 17.0 for windows.\n\nThe values of nucleotide contents in complete coding region of all 30 RHDV genomes were analyzed and listed in Table 2 and Table 3 . Evidently, (C+G)% content of the ORF1 fluctuated from 50.889 to 51.557 with a mean value of 51.14557, and (C+G)% content of the ORF2 were ranged from 35.593 to 40.113 with a mean value of 37.6624, which were indicating that nucleotides A and U were the major elements of ORF2 against ORF1. Comparing the values of A 3 %, U 3 %, C 3 % and G 3 %, it is clear that C 3 % was distinctly high and A 3 % was the lowest of all in ORF1 of RHDV, while U 3 % was distinctly high and C 3 % was the lowest of all in ORF2 of Table 2 Identified nucleotide contents in complete coding region (length > 250 bps) in the ORF1 of RHDV (30 isolates) genome Table 4 . Most preferentially used codons in ORF1 were C-ended or G-ended codons except Ala, Pro and Ser, however, A-ended or G-ended codons were preferred as the content of ORF2. In addition, the dn, ds and \u03c9(dN/dS) values of ORF1 were separately 0.014, 0.338 and 0.041, and the values of ORF2 were 0.034, 0.103 and 0.034, respectively. The \u03c9 values of two ORFs in RHDV genome are generally low, indicating that the RHDV whole genome is subject to relatively strong selective constraints.\n\nCOA was used to investigate the major trend in codon usage variation between two ORFs of all 30 RHDV selected for this study. After COA for RHDV Genome, one major trend in the first axis (f' 1 ) which accounted for 42.967% of the total variation, and another major trend in the second axis (f' 2 ) which accounted for 3.632% of the total variation. The coordinate of the complete coding region of each ORF was plotted in Figure 1 defining by the first and second principal axes. It is clear that coordinate of each ORF is relatively isolated. Interestingly, we found that relatively isolated spots from ORF2 tend to cluster into two groups: the ordinate value of one group (marked as Group 1) is \n\nTo estimate whether the evolution of RHDV genome on codon usage was regulated by mutation pressure or natural selection, the A%, U%, C%, G% and (C+G)% were compared with A 3 %, U 3 %, C 3 %, G 3 % and (C 3 +G 3 )%, respectively (Table 5 ). There is a complex correlation among nucleotide compositions. In detail, A 3 %, U 3 %, C 3 % and G 3 % have a significant negative correlation with G%, C%, U% and A% and positive correlation with A%, U%, C% and G%, respectively. It suggests that nucleotide constraint may influence synonymous codon usage patterns. However, A 3 % has non-correlation with U% and C%, and U 3 % has noncorrelation with A% and G%, respectively, which haven't indicated any peculiarity about synonymous codon usage. Furthermore, C 3 % and G 3 % have non-correlation with A%, G% and U%, C%, respectively, indicating these data don't reflect the true feature of synonymous codon usage as well. Therefore, linear regression analysis was implemented to analyze the correlation between synonymous codon usage bias and nucleotide compositions. Details of correlation analysis between the first two principle axes (f' 1 and f' 2 ) of each RHDV genome in COA and nucleotide contents were listed in Table 6 . In surprise, only f2 values are closely related to base nucleotide A and G content on the third codon position only, suggesting that nucleotide A and G is a factor influencing the synonymous codon usage pattern of RHDV genome. However, f' 1 value has non-correlation with base nucleotide contents on the third codon position; it is observably suggest that codon usage patterns in RHDV were probably influenced by other factors, such as the second structure of viral genome and limits of host. In spite of that, compositional constraint is a factor shaping the pattern of synonymous codon usage in RHDV genome. Figure 1 A plot of value of the first and second axis of RHDV genome in COA. The first axis (f' 1 ) accounts for 42.967% of the total variation, and the second axis (f' 2 ) accounts for 3.632% of the total variation. Table 5 Summary of correlation analysis between the A, U, C, G contents and A 3 , U 3 , C 3 , G 3 contents in all selected samples \n\nThere have been more and more features that are unique to RHDV within the family Caliciviridae, including its single host tropism, its genome and its VP10 as a structural protein with unknown function. After we analyzed synonymous codon usage in RHDV (Table 2) , we obtained several conclusions and conjectures as followed.\n\n4.1 Mutational bias as a main factor leading to synonymous codon usage variation ENC-plot, as a general strategy, was utilized to investigate patterns of synonymous codon usage. The ENC-plots of ORFs constrained only by a C 3 +G 3 composition will lie on or just below the curve of the predicted values [18] . ENC values of RHDV genomes were plotted against its corresponding (C 3 +G 3 ) %. All of the spots lie below the curve of the predicted values, as shown in Figure 2 , suggesting that the codon usage bias in all these 30 RHDV genomes is principally influenced by the mutational bias.\n\nAs we know, the efficiency of gene expression is influenced by regulator sequences or elements and codon usage bias. It reported that the RNA sequence of the 3terminal 84 nucleotides of ORF1were found to be crucial for VP10 expression instead of the encoded peptide. VP10 coding by ORF2 has been reported as a low expressive structural protein against VP60 coding by ORF1 [5] . And its efficiency of translation is only 20% of VP60. According to results showed by Table 4 , it revealed the differences in codon usage patterns of two ORFs, which is a possible factor reducing the expression of VP10.\n\nAlthough VP10 encoded by ORF2, as a minor structural protein with unknown functions, has been described by LIU as a nonessential protein for virus infectivity, the \u03c9 Figure 2 Effective number of codons used in each ORF plotted against the GC3s. The continuous curve plots the relationship between GC3s and ENC in the absence of selection. All of spots lie below the expected curve.\n\nvalue of ORF2 suggests VP10 plays an important role in the certain stage of whole RHDV lifecycle. After combining with low expression and \u03c9 value of VP10, we conjectured that VP10 might be beneficial for the replication, release or both of virus by inducing infected cell apoptosis initiate by RHDV. This mechanism has been confirmed in various positive-chain RNA viruses, including coxsackievirus, dengue virus, equine arterivirus, footand-mouth disease virus, hepatitis C virus, poliovirus, rhinovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , although the details remain elusive.\n\nAs preceding description, ENC reflects the evolution of codon usage variation and nucleotide composition to some degree. After the correlation analysis of ENC values between ORF1 and ORF2 (Table 7) , the related coefficient of ENC values of two ORFs is 0.230, and p value is 0.222 more than 0.05. These data revealed that no correlation existed in ENC values of two ORFs, indicating that codon usage patterns and evolution of two ORFs are separated each other. Further, this information maybe helps us well understand why RSCU and ENC between two ORFs are quite different.\n\nInterestingly, we found that relatively isolated spots from ORF2 tend to cluster into two groups: the ordinate value of one group (marked as Group 1) is positive value and the other one (marked as Group 2) is negative value. And all of those strains isolated before 2000 belonged to Group 2, including Italy-90, RHDV-V351, RHDV-FRG, BS89, RHDV-SD and M67473.1. Although RHDV has been reported as only one type, this may be a reference on dividing into two genotypes.\n\nIn this report, we firstly analyzed its genome and two open reading frameworks (ORFs) from this aspect of codon usage bias. Our researches indicated that mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important determinant in RHDV with high codon bias, and the codon usage bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and ORF2, which is maybe one of factors regulating the expression of VP60 (encoding by ORF1) and VP10\n\n(encoding by ORF2). Furthermore, negative selective constraints on the RHDV whole genome implied that VP10 played an important role in RHDV lifecycle. We conjectured that VP10 might be beneficial for the replication, release or both of virus by inducing infected cell apoptosis initiate by RHDV. According to the results of the principal component analysis for ORF2 of RSCU, we firstly separated 30 RHDV into two genotypes, and the ENC values indicated ORF1 and ORF2 were independent among the evolution of RHDV. All the results will guide the next researches on the RHDV as a reference.", "document_id": 1567}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why do respiratory tract infections pose major public health problems?", "id": 1608, "answers": [{"text": "world-wide occurrence, ease of transmission and considerable morbidity and mortality effecting people of all ages", "answer_start": 1878}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How much of a greater risk are children than adults to viral infections?", "id": 1609, "answers": [{"text": "two to three times more frequently", "answer_start": 2026}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the most common infection in childhood?", "id": 1610, "answers": [{"text": "acute RTI", "answer_start": 2079}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What can respiratory viruses cause?", "id": 1611, "answers": [{"text": "common colds, pharyngitis, croup, bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia and otitis media", "answer_start": 2207}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When do respiratory infections usually happen?", "id": 1613, "answers": [{"text": "during winter and early spring months", "answer_start": 2759}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the most common viruses?", "id": 1614, "answers": [{"text": "respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B (INF-A, INF-B) viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), and human adenoviruses (HAdVs)", "answer_start": 2831}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the most common viral infection for infants up to 3 months old?", "id": 1629, "answers": [{"text": "RSV", "answer_start": 10294}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the incidence of RSV in children older than 3 years of age?", "id": 1630, "answers": [{"text": "13%", "answer_start": 10504}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Aetiology of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Hospitalised Children in Cyprus\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4720120/\n\nSHA: efd27ff0ac04dd60838266386aaebb5df80f4fa9\n\nAuthors: Richter, Jan; Panayiotou, Christakis; Tryfonos, Christina; Koptides, Dana; Koliou, Maria; Kalogirou, Nikolas; Georgiou, Eleni; Christodoulou, Christina\nDate: 2016-01-13\nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0147041\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: In order to improve clinical management and prevention of viral infections in hospitalised children improved etiological insight is needed. The aim of the present study was to assess the spectrum of respiratory viral pathogens in children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infections in Cyprus. For this purpose nasopharyngeal swab samples from 424 children less than 12 years of age with acute respiratory tract infections were collected over three epidemic seasons and were analysed for the presence of the most common 15 respiratory viruses. A viral pathogen was identified in 86% of the samples, with multiple infections being observed in almost 20% of the samples. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV (30.4%) and Rhinovirus (27.4%). RSV exhibited a clear seasonality with marked peaks in January/February, while rhinovirus infections did not exhibit a pronounced seasonality being detected almost throughout the year. While RSV and PIV3 incidence decreased significantly with age, the opposite was observed for influenza A and B as well as adenovirus infections. The data presented expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections in Cypriot children and will be helpful to the clinicians and researchers interested in the treatment and control of viral respiratory tract infections.\n\nText: Viral Respiratory tract infections (RTI) represent a major public health problem because of their world-wide occurrence, ease of transmission and considerable morbidity and mortality effecting people of all ages. Children are on average infected two to three times more frequently than adults, with acute RTIs being the most common infection in childhood [1, 2] . Illnesses caused by respiratory viruses include, among others, common colds, pharyngitis, croup, bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia and otitis media. Rapid diagnosis is important not only for timely therapeutic intervention but also for the identification of a beginning influenza epidemic and the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic treatment [3, 4] .\n\nRTIs are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Acute RTI is most common in children under five years of age, and represents 30-50% of the paediatric medical admissions, as well as 20-40% of hospitalizations in children. Respiratory infections cluster during winter and early spring months. The leading viral agents include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B (INF-A, INF-B) viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), and human adenoviruses (HAdVs). In addition, there is a continuously increasing list of new respiratory viruses that contribute significantly to the burden of acute respiratory infections, such as the recently identified human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human Bocavirus (HBoV) [5] .\n\nAcute RTIs are classified as upper (UTRIs) and lower RTI (LRTIs), according to the involved anatomic localization. URTIs cause non-severe but widespread epidemics that are responsible for continuous circulation of pathogens in the community. LRTIs have been classified as frank pneumonia and bronchiolitis with clinical, radiological and etiological features that usually overlap [6, 7] . Viruses are again the foremost agents of LRTIs often misdiagnosed as bacterial in origin and hence treated with antibiotics unnecessarily [8] .\n\nThe main aim of this study was to determine the aetiology of acute respiratory tract infections in Cypriot children and assess the epidemiology of the identified viral pathogens over three epidemic seasons.\n\nThe study was approved by the Cyprus National Bioethics Committee. Accordingly, written informed consent was obtained from parents prior to sample taking. Between November 2010 and October 2013, 485 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from children up to 12 years of age, who had been hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection at the Archbishop Makarios III hospital, Nicosia. Clinical and demographic information including symptoms, duration of hospitalisation, diagnosis and treatment were recorded. Nasal swab samples were collected using the BD Universal Viral Transport Collection Kit. Viral RNA/DNA was extracted from 400 \u03bcl sample using the iPrep PureLink Virus Kit on an iPrep purification instrument (Invitrogen).\n\nA set of four multiplex Real-Time RT-PCR assays was established and validated for the detection of the 15 most common respiratory viruses as follows: assay 1: influenzaviruses A and B, RSV, assay 2: parainfluenzaviruses 1-4, assay 3: HAdV, enteroviruses, HMPV and HBoV and assay 4: rhinoviruses and the human coronaviruses OC43, NL63 and 229E (Table 1) .\n\nPublished primer and probe sets were used as a basis for designing the assays, however, all primer/probe sequences were checked against newly build sequence alignments of all viruses tested and were modified, if necessary, to account for possible sequence variations. For this purpose, all available complete genome sequences were obtained for each virus from GenBank, imported into the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor v7.1.7 and aligned using ClustalX. In case of mismatches between published primers/probe and target sequences, modifications were applied, as indicated in Table 1 . The alignments for the viruses, which necessitated changes to the primers/probe are available in Fasta-Format as supplement S1-S4 Files.\n\nPrimer concentrations and reaction conditions for the four assays were subsequently optimised for multiplexing. In order to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the assays, the laboratory enrolled for two consecutive years in Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD) external quality assessment schemes for all viruses, except Bocavirus, which was unavailable. In summary, the established assays were able to correctly identify all viruses tested, proving their suitability for diagnostic application.\n\nA possible correlation of virus prevalence and age of infection was assessed using univariate analyses. The Fisher's exact test was used where cell counts below 5 were encountered; otherwise, the chi-squared test was performed. The same statistical tests were used to compare the frequency of subjects with single or multiple infections between age groups. In addition, Pearson correlation was used to examine co-infections of different viruses. All statistical analyses were performed using StataSE 12 (StatCorp. 2007. College Station, TX, USA).\n\nThe present study was a prospective investigation of children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infections between November 2010 and October 2013 in Cyprus. The median age of the children was 15 months (range: 0-140 months) with 243 being male and 181 female (male/ female ratio 1.34). The age distribution is shown in Fig 1. \n\nOut of the 424 samples analysed, 364 (85.8%) were positive for one or more viruses. Results are summarized in Table 2 .The most commonly detected viruses were RSV, which was found in 129 (30.4%) patients and rhinoviruses in 116 (27.4%) accounting together for almost 60% of all detections. With moderate frequency have been detected HAdV in 31(7.3%) patients, influenza A in 28 (6.6%), HBoV in 24 (5.7%), enteroviruses and PIV 3 in 23 (5.4%) of patients respectively, and Influenza B in 21 (5.0%). A low frequency was exhibited by HMPV with 16 (3.8%) positive samples, human coronavirus OC43 with 13 (3.1%), PIV 1 with 12 (2.8%), PIV 4 with 9 (2.1%), PIV 2 with 7 (1.7%) and HCoV NL63 with 6 (1.4%). Coronavirus 229E could be detected only in a single sample.\n\nCo-infections with two or more viruses were observed in 84 out of the 364 positive samples (see Table 2 ). Dual infections accounted for 17% of all positive samples and three viruses were detected in 2.7% of samples). A single patient sample displayed a quadruple infection being simultaneously positive for RSV, rhinovirus, HBoV and influenza B. Table 3 summarizes the frequency of each virus in single vs. multiple infections as well as the number of co-occurrences of viruses for each possible virus combination. In absolute terms the most common combination observed was RSV/rhinovirus. As a percentage, however, the virus appearing most often in co- infections was HBoV, which was found in more than 70% of cases together with another virus, followed by coronaviruses HCoV OC43 and HCoV NL63 with 61% and 67%, respectively. On the other hand, the viruses most rarely seen in co-infections were influenza viruses A and B as well as RSV. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the likelihood of co-infections of different viruses. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 1 in S1 Table. Significant correlation (P-value < 0.05) was seen mostly for co-infections with RSV, however correlations were very weak (r<0.3) and negative. This finding can probably be explained by the fact that RSV infections occurred predominantly in the very young, where co-infections were less frequently observed. On the other hand, a significant positive correlation was observed for enterovirus and rhinovirus co-infection hinting maybe at similarities in circulation patterns and/or transmission modes.\n\nRegarding seasonality, different patterns of circulations could be observed for RSV, rhinoviruses and influenzaviruses (A and B combined) (Fig 2) , with RSV and influenza exhibiting a clear seasonality with marked peaks in January/February, while rhinovirus infections did not exhibit a pronounced seasonality being detected almost throughout the year. However, as more than 100 different rhinovirus strains have been identified to be circulating worldwide in parallel and successively, a potential seasonality of individual rhinovirus serotypes may be masked by overlapping patterns [18, 19] .\n\nThe data was further analysed with regard to the age distribution of virus infection (see Table 2 ). In infants up to 3 months old, RSV was by far the most common pathogen (58.1%), followed by rhinovirus (20.3%) and PIV3 with 8.1% each. The incidence of RSV, however, decreases significantly with increasing age (p-value < 0.0001) dropping to 13% in children older than 3 years old, while the reverse relationship is observed for Influenza A and B and HAdV. Rhinoviruses, HBoV and enteroviruses are most frequently observed in children from 4 months to 3 years of age. The age dependency of the virus incidence is visualized in Fig 3 for the seven most frequently observed viruses. The positivity rate also showed a trend according to the age group dropping from 90.5% in the under 3-month old to 78.3% in the 4-12 years old (p-value = 0.020). This may point to an increasing role of pathogens not included in the assays, such as bacterial infections in older children.\n\nRegarding multiple infections, children less than 3 month of age and those older than 4 years had a significantly smaller risk to present with multiple infections as compared to the other two age groups (p-value = 0.014).\n\nA reason for this could be that very young children have limited contact to others reducing thereby the chance for a co-infection, whereas children older than 3 years already established immunity to an increasing number of viruses encountered previously.\n\nThis study for the first time examined the aetiology of acute respiratory tract infections in hospitalised children in Cyprus. Four multiplex Real-Time RT-PCR assays were developed in order to detect the most common respiratory viral pathogens in a fast and cost-effective way. The high rate of positive samples (85.8%) is evidence of the high sensitivity of the Multiplex-assays used and that the range of viruses included in the analysis is comprehensive. Many previous studies have shown detection rates ranging from below 50% to 75% [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .\n\nThe most common viruses detected were RSV and rhinovirus accounting for almost 60% of all cases. Both viruses were reported previously by others as the major aetiology for respiratory viral infections in young children with rhinoviruses being recognized increasingly for their role in lower respiratory tract infections [20, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .\n\nOur data support the results of similar studies performed in the Middle East region. A recently published study found that RSV was the most commonly detected virus in nasopharyngeal swabs from children presenting symptoms of RTIs and in addition to that it also showed that RSV infections follow a similar circulation pattern peaking from December to March [31] . Another study has revealed that RSV and PIV3 incidence decreases significantly with age, whereas the opposite is observed for influenza and adenovirus infections, a trend that was also observed in our study [26] .\n\nMixed infections were observed in approximately 20% of all samples, which is in the middle of previously reported rates ranging from 10 to almost 40%. HBoV, HCoV and EV were found most frequently in co-infections. All three subtypes of HCoV were co-detected with several other viruses, while HBoV was co-detected mainly with HRV and RSV. In the case of EV infections, EV were almost predominantly associated with HRV. The rare presence of InfA and InfB viruses in multiple infections witnessed in our study was also observed elsewhere [32, 33] . Even though this study did not allow for investigating a possible association between multiple infections and disease severity, a review of the literature shows that such a potential association is still subject to controversy, since there are reports showing no relationship of multiple virus infection with respiratoty illness severity on one hand or a significant association on the other. Studies have shown that viral co-infection was significantly associated with longer duration of illness symptoms, but with a decreased severity in hospitalized children regarding oxygen requirement and intensive care unit admission, whereas the findings of other studies have indicated that severe clinical phenotypes were more prevalent in co-infection patients, especially in RSV co-infections that may increase the severity of RSV associated disease in children [25, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] .\n\nViral respiratory infections continue to be a worldwide health concern. As the clinical symptoms of patients with acute respiratory tract infections do usually not allow a discrimination of viral or bacterial aetiology, rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are required for better antibiotic stewardship and the implementation of appropriate infection control measures [4, 41] .

Nevertheless some questions remain and not all lessons have been successful. The national and international response demonstrates the complex link between public health, science and politics when an outbreak threatens to impact on global economies and reputations. The unprecedented measures implemented in China are a bold attempt to control the outbreak \u2013 we need to understand their effectiveness to balance costs and benefits for similar events in the future.\n\nText: On 29 December 2019 clinicians in a hospital in Wuhan City, China noticed a clustering of cases of unusual pneumonia (with the first case identified at that time on 12 December) with an apparent link to a market that sells live fish, poultry and animals to the public. This event was reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 31 December [1]. Within 4 weeks, by 26 January 2020, the causative organism had been identified as a novel coronavirus, the genome of the virus had been sequenced and published, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests had been developed, the WHO R&D Blueprint had been activated to accelerate diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine development and a candidate vaccine was ready for initial laboratory testing. Currently Chinese health authorities are building a 1000 bed hospital in Wuhan in 10 days.\n\nBy 26 January also, almost 50 million people in Wuhan and neighbouring cities had effectively been placed in quarantine while the WHO had determined that the event should not yet be declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [2] and had recommended no specific travel restrictions. The WHO have emphasised the importance of exit screening at ports in countries showing transmission of the novel coronavirus and have provided guidance for countries implementing entry screening at airports while acknowledging that evidence for the effectiveness of entry screening is equivocal.\n\nThis response is one of the swiftest, coordinated global responses to an emerging infectious disease the world has seen in modern times, but is it the appropriate response, will it be effective and is it sustainable?\n\nAccording to the situation report published by the WHO on 28 January 2020 [3], a total of 2798 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases have been reported globally; of these, 2761 cases were from China, including Hong Kong (8 cases), Macau (5) and Taipei (4). Thirty-seven confirmed cases have been reported outside of China in eleven countries in Europe, North America, Australia and Asia; of these 37 exported cases, 36 had a travel history from China or an epidemiological link to a case from China. Of the confirmed cases in China, 461 have been reported as severely ill, with 80 deaths to date.\n\nThis outbreak and the response to it illustrate some key issues about how global preparedness and response capacity for outbreaks have evolved over almost two decades since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002/3 and what lessons have, or have not, been learned. It also raises questions about the impact these lessons have had on the way agencies and governments respond to these events and about the role of the WHO and the International Health Regulations (IHR).\n\nOne of the critical lessons from the SARS experience was the absolute necessity to be able to coordinate the international resources that are available in an outbreak and to get them focussed on identifying priorities and solving problems. The WHO established the means to do this for SARS and it has since been further developed and integrated into global preparedness, especially after the West Africa Ebola epidemic. Organisations such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Global Research Collaboration For Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) have been supported by the WHO Research Blueprint and its Global Coordinating Mechanism to provide a forum where those with the expertise and capacity to contribute to managing new threats can come together both between and during outbreaks to develop innovative solutions to emerging problems. This global coordination has been active in the novel coronavirus outbreak. WHO's response system includes three virtual groups based on those developed for SARS to collate real time information to inform real time guidelines, and a first candidate vaccine is ready for laboratory testing within 4 weeks of the virus being identified.\n\nAnother key factor in successfully preventing and managing emerging threats is the rapid and transparent sharing of information between countries and agencies. There was extensive criticism of China for its perceived failure to share information about the emerging SARS infection early enough in the outbreak to allow countries to prepare and respond. There were similar concerns about information sharing as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) emerged and evolved in the Middle East in 2012, particularly in Saudi Arabia, and about the emergence of Ebola in West Africa in 2014.\n\nOn this occasion information sharing seems to have been rapid and effective (while recognising that the information available in the early stages of an outbreak is always less than the global community would like). The WHO was notified of the original clustering within days and the full genomic sequence of the new virus was published less than 2 weeks after the cluster was first detected. The WHO has expressed its satisfaction with the actions of the Chinese authorities in sharing information with the WHO.\n\nWorking with journalists and the media to help them understand the science and epidemiology, particularly in a fast moving event, will improve risk communication to the public and reduce inappropriate concerns and panic.\n\nWhile reporting of this outbreak shows signs of the efforts of epidemiologists, infectious disease experts, national and international public health agencies and others engaging with journalists, there are also signs that this is not yet achieving it's goal. For example, the public perception is that the increase in case numbers reported daily by the Chinese authorities represents a daily escalation in the epidemic while the reality is that these numbers are also the result of active, aggressive, case finding in China and some of these cases are 'old' cases newly recognised as being due to the novel coronavirus. Similarly the virus is usually described by the media as 'deadly' and although this is true in the sense that it has caused deaths, the nuances of uncertain case fatality rates in the early stages of an outbreak are not being communicated. The current estimated case fatality rate seems to be around 3% which is significant but not comparable to the 10% rate for SARS or 34% reported for MERS. These misperceptions are still driving public anxiety.\n\nTo supplement formal reporting mechanisms between countries and with WHO (including the IHR), the use of informal mechanisms such as media and social media reports was advocated in the light of the SARS experience. There are now globally several systems that provide collated information from informal reporting including networks of experts and scanning of media and social media. These contribute to, and amplify, epidemic intelligence and are being integrated with national and international surveillance systems.\n\nThe value, and the challenges, of this additional source of information has been evident in the current outbreak. The value comes from ensuring that early indications of cases beyond the initial outbreak city have been detected and can supplement the global risk assessment and monitoring of the evolution of the outbreak. The challenges lie in the volume and diversity of the information available and the relative lack of verification mechanisms, such that one of these systems (ProMed) has commented that it was becoming increasingly difficult to assimilate the information being supplied [4] and to make meaningful interpretations.\n\nEarly in the outbreak it was reported that health workers had not been infected. This was reassuring because it is health workers who many times, and inadvertently, amplify transmission. Failure to wash hands between patients, for example, can result not only in autoinfection, but also in infection of patients hospitalised for other causes when they provide care. Autoinfection is not only a risk for the health worker, but also for their families and the communities in which they live, depending on the transmissibility and means of transmission. More recently infection, and at least one death, in health workers has been confirmed. Although not unexpected this does add to the epidemiological risk.\n\nA characteristic of the SARS outbreak was the variability of transmissibility between cases and the occurrence of 'superspreading events' where a case infected significantly more contacts than the average. This was also seen with MERS in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea (RoK). In this current novel coronavirus outbreak, such superspreading events have not been documented but the epidemiology is still not clear. Confirming whether or not this is happening must be an urgent task for the Chinese investigation. Modellers have suggested reproductive rates (R 0 ) of 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0) [5] and 2.6 (1.5-3.5) [6] ; R 0 for SARS was estimated at around 3 in the absence of control measures [7] .\n\nThe economic impact of major outbreaks can be substantial for the affected country. This was seen clearly in SARS, MERS in RoK and Ebola in West Africa. One analyst estimates that the current coronavirus outbreak's likely impact will range from a 0.8% cut to real GDP if the epidemic is controlled within 3 months, to a 1.9% cost to GDP if the epidemic lasts 9 months [8] . This may increase substantially in the light of the extended restrictions on movement, and therefore trade and commerce, within China.\n\nThe emergence of a significant respiratory illness linked to a novel coronavirus represents a test of the global capacity to detect and mange emerging disease threats. Its emergence in China adds an additional dimension in the light of previous experience with SARS. The timing of the outbreak immediately before the Chinese Lunar New Year with its attendant population movements adds extra risk and urgency to the response.\n\nThe rapid sharing of information in this outbreak and the speed of the coordinated response both in the country and internationally suggest that lessons have been learned from SARS that improve global capacity. The international networks and forums that now exist have facilitated the bringing together of expertise from around the world to focus research and development efforts and maximise the impact.\n\nAt this early stage in the outbreak information remains incomplete and key clinical and epidemiological questions have not yet been answered, but the deficit seems to be due more to the constraints of investigating an emerging disease than to any unwillingness to engage and share information with partners.\n\nThere are some indications of areas where further improvement is necessary. The global media response to the unfolding events has been relatively balanced and informed but the nuances of the evolving situation have not been critically examined in partnership with the media and as a result the public perception of the risk may be exaggeratedalthough it of course remains possible that the outbreak will develop in a way that matches up to the perceived risk. The lack of appreciation of the uncertainties in determining a meaningful case fatality rate and the significance of ascertainment bias at the beginning of an outbreak, along with the impact of aggressive case finding on case numbers, are examples of where understanding could be improved. This is always a challenging process when balancing the resources focussed on analysing the situation on the ground with resources directed at interpreting the information for journalists but in SARS, the R 0 was seen to decrease in response to information reaching the public and the public then adopting risk reduction actions [6] ; so accurate public risk communication is critical to success. It would be helpful to find a forum where this can be explored with the media community after the event.\n\nThe increase in access to early information from diverse sources including media and social media adds an important dimension to identifying and tracking new events globally and is a key part of the overall epidemic intelligence system. However, it is also a potential source of disinformation. When, as has been seen in this outbreak, the volume of information coming in exceeds any capacity to collate and analyse it and to attempt to cross-reference and verify separate items, there is a risk that the information fuels speculation and media and public concern. Again there is a fine balance between information that encourages appropriate risk avoidance actions and information that encourages inappropriate actions; however the public health is usually better served by more information rather than less.\n\nThe role of a declaration of a PHEIC in managing a serious outbreak has been questioned in the light of Ebola in West Africa and in the Democratic Republic of Congo [9] and has been challenged again with this outbreak. The binary nature of a PHEIC declaration (either an event is a PHEIC or it isn'tthere are no intermediate options) and the specificity of the three defined criteria for a PHEIC have caused difficulty for Emergency Committees in considering whether a given event should be a PHEIC. The lack of a clear understanding of what a PHEIC declaration is meant to achieve adds to the Emergency Committee's difficulties, as does the relative paucity of clinical and epidemiological answers at this stage of the investigation. In this instance the Emergency Committee were divided in coming to a conclusion but decided on balance that the current situation, although an emergency, should not as yet be declared a PHEIC [2]. As with Ebola in the DRC, there has been criticism of the WHO for this decision but, as with Ebola, it is not immediately clear what would be different in the response if a PHEIC was declared.\n\nThe WHO is working on improving the way in which Emergency Committees develop their advice for the Director General but, as recommended by this Emergency Committee and the post-Ebola IHR Review Committee in 2015, the development of an intermediate alert alongside WHO's risk assessment process may be helpful.\n\nA key function of a PHEIC declaration is that it is the (only) gateway to the WHO Temporary Recommendations on possible travel and trade restrictions to limit international spread of a disease. In this case several countries globally had already implemented entry screening at airports and China had begun closing down international travel from Wuhan before the Emergency Committee had finished their deliberations. While the WHO would not, and could not, interfere with the sovereign decisions of member states, the lack of influence on travel and trade decisions could prove problematic.\n\nAlongside the speed of the response in this outbreak, we have seen dramatic changes in the scale of the response. The imposition of very extensive quarantine measures on millions of people as an attempt to break the transmission of the virus is unprecedented. We do not know whether they will be effective; indeed we do not know how we will determine if they have been effectivewhat end point can we measure that will provide an answer to that question? If recent suggestions that people infected with this coronavirus may be infectious while incubating or asymptomatic, and the reports that up to 5 m people left Wuhan before the travel restrictions were imposed, are confirmed, the efficacy of these control measures will be more challenged.\n\nGiven the likely impact on at least the Chinese economy and probably the global economy, it will be important to understand the role and the effectiveness of public health measures on this scale for the future.\n\nHowever, the imposition of these dramatic measures does also raise a wider question: if there is an impact from these measures, what other countries would (or could) implement such measures? Would other countries accept the self-imposed economic damage that China has accepted to try and contain this outbreak? Is it reasonable to consider that national governments would close down public transport into and out of London, New York or Paris in the week before Christmas even if it were shown to be an effective control measure?\n\nThese decisions and questions cross the interface between public health, science and politics. The response to this outbreak in\n\nChina was inevitably influenced by the historical reaction to the country's response to SARS and the world's suspicion of China's lack of cooperation at that time. The current response is therefore framed within a context of not wanting to be seen to be behaving in the same way with this event.\n\nThis may indicate another impact of the SARS (and MERS and Ebola) experience on the response to subsequent outbreaksa tendency to look at worst case scenarios and respond accordingly and a fear of 'getting it wrong'. This can deter leaders at all levels, from outbreak teams to national governments, from making judgements when all the information they would like is not available in case those judgments turn out to be wrong when the full information becomes available.\n\nIn emergency response it is generally better to over-react and then scale back if necessary rather than under-react and then act too late. Response should be on a 'no regrets' basismake the best decisions possible on the basis of the best information and science available at the time but do not judge or criticise if later information suggests a different course of action. The early response must recognise what is known and what is not known and look at what of the unknowns can reasonably be estimated by reference to previous outbreaks, similar pathogens, early reporting and modelling, etc. The risk assessment and response can then be modified and refined as information on the unknowns evolves.\n\nKey to that approach, however, is confidence that decisions will not be criticised based on information that was not available at the time. It is also important to be ready to change decisions when the available information changessomething that both scientists and politicians can find difficult.\n\nIn that context, China should not be judged for implementing what might appear to be extreme measures but China should also be prepared to discontinue the measures quickly if evidence suggests they are not the best way to solve the problem. By closing airports the international spread from Wuhan may be decreased, but success will depend on how effective the measures really are at stopping people moving out of the affected area as well as on the behaviour of the virus.

We previously showed that influenza virus M2 or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B proteins stimulate IL-1\u03b2 secretion following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the mechanism by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we provide direct evidence that SARS-CoV 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages. SARS-CoV 3a was sufficient to cause the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated IL-1\u03b2 secretion. While cells uninfected or infected with a lentivirus expressing a 3a protein defective in ion channel activity expressed NLRP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, NLRP3 was redistributed to the perinuclear space in cells infected with a lentivirus expressing the 3a protein. K(+) efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were important for SARS-CoV 3a-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results highlight the importance of viroporins, transmembrane pore-forming viral proteins, in virus-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n\nText: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of the genus Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb in length. The 5 two-thirds of the genome encodes large polyprotein precursors, open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF1b, which are proteolytically cleaved to generate 16 non-structural proteins (Tan et al., 2005) . The 3 one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and non-structural proteins, along with a set of accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b) (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005; Tan et al., 2005) . SARS-CoV is the etiological agent of SARS (Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . At least 8,098 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection, with a fatality rate of 9.6%, were reported to the World Health Organization from November 2002 to July 2003. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6, were detected in autopsy tissues from SARS patients (He et al., 2006) . Although dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines may be involved in lung injury and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.\n\nThe innate immune systems utilizes pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (Medzhitov, 2001; Kawai and Akira, 2010) . Recognition of virus infection plays an important role in limiting virus replication at the early stages of infection. Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including virus infection (Bauernfeind et al., 2011) . Four models describing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome have been proposed thus far (Hornung and Latz, 2010; Schroder et al., 2010; Tschopp and Schroder, 2010) . First, the disturbances in intracellular ionic concentrations, including K + efflux and Ca 2+ influx, play an important role (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2007; Petrilli et al., 2007; Arlehamn et al., 2010; Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Murakami et al., 2012; Munoz-Planillo et al., 2013) . Second, cathepsin B and L, which are specific lysosomal cysteine proteases, are though to play a role after phagocytosis of cholesterol crystals (Duewell et al., 2010) , fibrillar peptide amyloid-beta , silica crystals, and aluminum salts . Third is the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or mitochondrial DNA from damaged mitochondria (Zhou et al., , 2011 Nakahira et al., 2011; Shimada et al., 2012) . Finally, viral RNA or RNA cleavage products generated by RNase L activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the DExD/H-box helicase, DHX33 (Allen et al., 2009; Mitoma et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2015) . Upon activation, the NLRP3 is recruited to the mitochondria via association with mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) or mitofusin 2 expressed on the outer mitochondrial membrane Subramanian et al., 2013) ; these molecules then recruit the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and pro-caspase-1 to form the NLRP3 inflammasome. This event activates the downstream molecule, caspase-1, which catalyzes the proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into their active forms and stimulates their secretion (Kayagaki et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015) .\n\nIt is increasingly evident that NLRP3 detects RNA viruses by sensing the cellular damage or distress induced by viroporins (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013; Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) , transmembrane pore-forming proteins, encoded by certain RNA viruses; these proteins alter membrane permeability to ions by forming membrane channels (Tan et al., 2005; Chen and Ichinohe, 2015) . A recent study shows that the SARS-CoV E protein, which comprise only 76 amino acids, forms Ca 2+ -permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . Although the E and 3a proteins of SARS-CoV, which comprise 274 amino acids and contain three transmembrane domains (Zeng et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2006) , are thought to act as Na + /K + and K + channels, respectively (Wilson et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2006; Torres et al., 2007; Parthasarathy et al., 2008; Pervushin et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011) , the role of the 3a protein in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we examined the role of the 3a protein in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\nSix-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Committees of the Institute of Medical Science (The University of Tokyo).\n\nBone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were prepared as described previously (Ichinohe et al., 2009) . In brief, bone marrow was obtained from the tibia and femur by flushing with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Nacalai Tesque). Bone marrow cells were cultured for 5 days in DMEM supplemented with 30% L929 cell supernatant containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), and L-glutamine (2 mM) at 37 \u2022 C/5% CO 2 . HEK293FT cells (a human embryonic kidney cell line) and HeLa cells (a human epithelial carcinoma cell line) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml) (Nacalai Tesque). MDCK cells (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells) and HT-1080 cells (a human fibrosarcoma cell line) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (E-MEM; Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml) (Nacalai Tesque).\n\nInfluenza A virus strain A/PR8 (H1N1) was grown at 35 \u2022 C for 2 days in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old fertile chicken eggs (Ichinohe et al., 2009) . The viral titer was quantified in a standard plaque assay using MDCK cells (Pang et al., 2013) .\n\nPlasmids cDNAs encoding the E and M proteins of SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 strain (Matsuyama et al., 2005) were obtained by reverse transcription and PCR of total RNA extracted from SARS-CoVinfected Vero cells, followed by PCR amplification using specific primers. pcDNA3.1D-3a-V5His was provided by Ming-Fu Chang (National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan). To generate the plasmids pLenti6-E-V5His, pLenti6-3a-V5His, and pLenti-M-V5His, cDNA fragments of E, 3a, and M were amplified from pcDNA3.1D-E-V5His, pcDNA3.1D-3a-V5His, and pcDNA3.1D-M-V5His using specific primer sets and then ligated into pLenti6-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen). To generate plasmids pCA7-flag-E, pCA7-flag-3a, and pCA7flag-M, pCA7-HA-E, pCA7-HA-3a, and pCA7-HA-M, cDNA fragments of E, 3a, and M were amplified from pcDNA3.1D-E-V5His, pcDNA3.1D-3a-V5His, and pcDNA3.1D-M-V5His using specific primer sets, digested with EcoR I and Not I, and subcloned into the EcoR I-Not I sites of the pCA7-flag-ASC plasmid or pCA7-HA-M2 plasmid, respectively (Ito et al., 2012) . To construct plasmids expressing the E mutant V25F, the mutated E fragments were amplified by inverse PCR with wildtype E-containing plasmids and specific primer sets. The PCR products were cleaved by Dpn I, ligated in a ligase-and T4 kinase-containing reaction and then transformed into DH5\u03b1 competent cells (TOYOBO). To construct plasmids expressing the 3a mutant 3a-CS, fragments were amplified from wildtype 3a-containing plasmids using 3a-specific primer sets and transformed as described above.\n\nHEK293FT cells were seeded in 24-well cluster plates and transfected with 1 \u00b5g pLenti6-E/3a/M-V5His, pLenti-GFP (green fluorescent protein), or pLenti-M2 using polyethylenimine (PEI) Max. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% NP-40, 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA). And the lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were incubated over night with mouse anti-V5-tag (R960-25, Invitrogen), mouse anti-influenza A virus M2 (14C2, Abcam), mouse anti-GFP (GF200, Nacalai Tesque), or rabbit antitubulin (DM1A, Santa Cruz) antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxide-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) or anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). After washing 3 times with washing buffer (0.05% Tween-20/PBS), the membranes were exposed using Chemi-Lumi One Super (Nacalai Tesque), and the chemiluminescent signals were captured by an ImageQuant LAS-4000 mini apparatus (GE Healthcare).\n\nTo generate lentiviruses expressing V5-tagged SARS-CoV E, 3a, and M proteins, the full-length cDNA encoding each viral protein was cloned into the pLenti6.3/V5-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) using the following primers: SARS-CoV E forward, 5 -caccatgtactcattcgtttcgga-3 , and reverse, 5 -gaccagaagatcaggaactc-3 ; SARS-CoV 3a forward, 5caccatggatttgtttatgagatt-3 , and reverse, 5 -caaaggcacgctagtagtcg-3 ; SARS-CoV M forward, 5 -caccatggcagacaacggtactat-3 , and reverse, 5 -ctgtactagcaaagcaatat-3 . Sub-confluent monolayers of HEK293FT cells seeded in a collagen-coated dish (10 cm in diameter) were transfected with 3 \u00b5g of pLenti6.3/V5-TOPO vector expressing each viral protein or EGFP together with ViraPower Packaging Mix (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The supernatants containing lentiviruses were harvested and filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter (Millipore) at 72-96 h post-transfection (Ito et al., 2012) . The lentiviral titer was then quantified using HT-1080 cells as described previously .\n\nBone marrow-derived macrophages were plated at a density of 8 \u00d7 10 5 in 24-well plate and infected with A/PR8 influenza virus or lentivirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 or 0.2 for 1 h, respectively. Then, BMMs were stimulated with 1 \u00b5g/ml of LPS and cultured for additional 23 h in complete media. Supernatants were collected at 24 h post-infection and centrifuged to remove cell debris. The amount of IL-1\u03b2 in the supernatants was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using paired antibodies (eBioscience) (Ichinohe et al., 2010 .\n\nTo clarify the cellular localization of the wild-type and mutant 3a proteins of SARS-CoV, HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips and transfected with 1 \u00b5g of pCA7-flag-3a or pCD7-flag-3a-CS together with 0.5 \u00b5g of ER-mCherry or DsRed-Golgi (Ito et al., 2012) . At 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100/PBS. After washing with PBS and blocking with 4% BSA/PBS, the cells were incubated with a mouse anti-flag antibody (M2, Sigma) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies).\n\nTo observe the cellular distribution of NLRP3 in the E-or 3a-expressing cells, HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips and transfected with 1 \u00b5g of pCA7-HA-E, pCA7-HA-EV25F, pCA7-HA-3a, pCA7-HA-3a-CS, or pCA7 control vector together with 0.5 \u00b5g of pCA7-NLRP3. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% Triton X-100/PBS. After washing and blocking, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-HA (561, MBL) and mouse anti-NLRP3 (Cryo-2; AdipoGen) antibodies, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies). Fluorescent signals were observed by confocal microscopy (A1R + , Nikon).\n\nStatistical significance was tested using a two-tailed Student's t-test. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nWe previously demonstrated that the influenza virus M2 protein (a proton-selective ion channel), its H37G mutant (which has lost its proton selectivity and enables the transport of other cations such as Na + and K + ), and the EMCV 2B protein (a Ca 2+ channel) stimulates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 secretion (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012) . In addition, the SARS-CoV E protein acts as a Ca 2+ -permeable ion channels that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto- Torres et al., 2015) . The fact that 3a protein of SARS-CoV acts as viroporin prompted us to examine whether it also triggers inflammasome activation. Thus, we first generated lentivirus plasmids expressing V5-tagged proteins and confirmed their expression in HEK293FT cells by immunoblot analysis (Figures 1A-C) . We next transduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed BMMs with the lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E, 3a, M, influenza virus M2, or EMCV 2B proteins. Consistent with previous reports (Ichinohe et al., Figure 1D) . Similarly, the lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins stimulated IL-1\u03b2 release from LPS-primed BMMs ( Figure 1D) . Furthermore, IL-1\u03b2 secretion from LPSprimed BMMs co-infected with E-and 3a-expressing lentiviruses was significantly higher than that from SARS-CoV E-expressing lentivirus-infected cells ( Figure 1E) . These data indicated that the expression of SARS-CoV viroporin 3a is sufficient to stimulate IL-1\u03b2 secretion by LPS-primed BMMs.\n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that the N-terminal 40 amino acids of the SARS-CoV E protein are important for ion channel formation, and that mutations N15A and V25F [located in the transmembrane domain (from amino acid residues 7-38)] prevent ion conductivity (Wilson et al., 2004; Torres et al., 2007; Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012) . In addition, the SARS-CoV 3a protein contains a cysteine-rich domain (amino acid residues 127-133) that is involved in the formation of a homodimer to generate the ion channel (Lu et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2009) . Thus, mutation of the cysteine-rich domain blocks the ion conductivity by the 3a protein (Chan et al., 2009) . To this end, we substituted amino acids Cys-127, Cys-130, and Cys-133 within the cysteine-rich domain of the SARS-CoV 3a protein with serine to generate a lentivirus expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutant, 3a-CS (Chan et al., 2009;  Figure 2A) . To test whether the ion channel activity of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is required to stimulate secretion of IL-1\u03b2, we transduced LPSprimed BMMs with lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E, V25F, 3a, 3a-CS, or M proteins. Consistent with a previous report (Nieto -Torres et al., 2015) , we found that the V25F mutant lentivirus failed to stimulate IL-1\u03b2 release from BMMs ( Figure 2B) . Notably, the 3a-CS mutant completely abrogated IL-1\u03b2 secretion (Figure 2B) , suggesting that the ion channel activity of the 3a protein is required for SARS-CoV 3a-induced IL-1\u03b2 secretion.\n\nFIGURE 4 | NLRP3 inflammasome activation by SARS-CoV 3a. HeLa cells were transfected with the expression plasmid encoding NLRP3 and that encoding HA-tagged SARS-CoV 3a, 3a-CS, E, or V25F, and by with a confocal microscope. Scale bars, 10 \u00b5m. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.\n\nNext, we determined the subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV 3a protein using confocal microscopy. When the SARS-CoV Cell-free supernatants were collected at 24 h (lentiviruses) or 6 h (ATP) post-infection or stimulation, and analyzed for IL-1\u03b2 by ELISA. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments, and indicate the mean \u00b1 SD; * * P < 0.01 and * * * P < 0.001.\n\n3a protein was expressed in HeLa cells, we observed two main distribution patterns. Consistent with previous reports (Yu et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2005) , the 3a protein localized to the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 3A ). In addition, the 3a proteins concentrated in spot structures, which mainly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 3B ). By contrast, the 3a-CS mutant was concentrated in the Golgi apparatus rather than in the ER and did not form spot structures (Figures 3A,B) . We next examined the intracellular localization of NLRP3. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome led to a redistribution from the cytosol to the perinuclear space, a process considered as a hallmark of NLRP3 activation (Zhou et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2013; Moriyama et al., 2016) . Although cells expressing the ion channel activity-loss mutants 3a-CS or V25F uniformly expressed NLRP3 throughout the cytoplasm, it was redistributed to the perinuclear region in SARS-CoV 3a-or E-expressing cells (Figure 4) . Together, these data provide evidence that the ion channel activity of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is essential for triggering the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\nBoth K + Efflux and ROS Production Are Involved in the IL-1\u03b2 Release Induced by the SARS-CoV 3a Protein\n\nFinally, we investigated the mechanism by which SARS-CoV 3a triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation. A previous study showed that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV acts as a K + channel (Lu et al., 2006) . In addition, K + efflux is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Mariathasan et al., 2006; Petrilli et al., 2007) . These observations prompted us to examine whether K + efflux is required for 3a-mediated IL-1\u03b2 secretion. To this end, BMMs in K + -rich medium were infected with influenza A virus or lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins. In agreement with a previous result (Ichinohe et al., 2010) , we found that IL-1\u03b2 secretion caused by influenza virus was completely blocked when the extracellular K + concentration was increased to 130 mM ( Figure 5A) . The inhibitory effect of the K + -rich medium was also observed when cells were stimulated with lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins ( Figure 5B ). Since mitochondrial ROS are important for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Nakahira et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011) , we next stimulated BMMs with extracellular ATP or lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV E or 3a proteins in the presence or absence of the antioxidant, Mito-TEMPO, a scavenger that is specific for mitochondrial ROS Trnka et al., 2009) . As reported previously (Nakahira et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2012) , treatment of BMMs with Mito-TEMPO completely blocked IL-1\u03b2 secretion in response to ATP ( Figure 6A) . Similarly, IL-1\u03b2 release induced by the SARS-CoV E and 3a proteins was significantly inhibited by Mito-TEMPO ( Figure 6B) . These observations indicate that the SARS-CoV 3a protein disrupts intracellular ionic concentrations and causes mitochondrial damages, thereby activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\nIn summary, we found that the ion channel activity of SARS-CoV 3a protein is essential for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, both K + efflux and mitochondrial ROS production are required for SARS-CoV 3a-mediated IL-1\u03b2 secretion.\n\nThus far, several models have been proposed to explain NLRP3 inflammasome activation by RNA viruses. First, viral RNA or RNA cleavage products generated by RNase L activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the DExD/H-box helicase, DHX33 (Allen et al., 2009; Mitoma et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2015) . Second, viroporins encoded by RNA viruses activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013; Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . In the case of influenza virus, the proton-selective M2 ion channel in the acidic trans-Golgi network activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Ichinohe et al., 2010) . Interestingly, an M2 mutant in which histidine was substituted with glycine at position 37 (H37G), causing loss of proton selectivity, enables transport of other cations (i.e., Na + and K + ), thereby leading to enhanced secretion of IL-1\u03b2 from LPS-primed BMMs and dendritic cells when compared with the wild-type M2 protein.\n\nIn addition, the 2B proteins of EMCV, poliovirus, enterovirus 71 (EV71), and human rhinovirus (a member of the Picornaviridae family) triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inducing Ca 2+ flux from the ER and Golgi compartments (Ito et al., 2012; Triantafilou et al., 2013) . Furthermore, hepatitis C virus stimulates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 production though its p7 viroporin (Negash et al., 2013; Farag et al., 2017) . Third, a recent study has demonstrated that the 3D protein of EV71 directly interacts with NLRP3 to facilitate the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome complex (Wang et al., 2017) .\n\nIn the case of SARS-CoV, the viroporin E forms forms Ca 2+permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Nieto-Torres et al., 2015) . In addition, another viroporin 3a was found to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Yue et al., 2018) . Although alanine substitution at Cys-133, which is required for dimer or tetramer formation (Lu et al., 2006) , still allows activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by interacting with caspase-1 (Yue et al., 2018) , the ion channel activity-loss mutant 3a-CS (Cys-to-Ser substitution at positions Cys-127, Cys-130, and Cys-133) (Chan et al., 2009 ) completely abrogated IL-1\u03b2 secretion from LPS-primed BMMs, suggesting that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV has the ability to induce the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by multiple mechanisms. Previous studies show that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV is localized to the plasma membrane (Minakshi and Padhan, 2014) and acts as a K + channel (Lu et al., 2006) , thereby (presumably) stimulating the K + efflux at the plasma membrane. Indeed, we found that IL-1\u03b2 secretion caused by the 3a protein was significantly inhibited when the extracellular K + concentration increased to 130 mM. Although it remains unclear whether another viroporin 8a of SARS-CoV (Castano-Rodriguez et al., 2018) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, these data highlights the importance of viroporins in SARS-CoV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. A better understanding of the mechanism that governs the NLRP3 inflammasome will facilitate the development of more effective interventions for the treatment of infectious diseases and increase our understanding of viral pathogenesis.", "document_id": 1595}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is critical to the development of a protective granuloma in tuberculosis infections?", "id": 887, "answers": [{"text": "tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1", "answer_start": 511}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is tumor necrosis factor-alpha?", "id": 888, "answers": [{"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 491}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What regulates the activity of MAPK activity?", "id": 889, "answers": [{"text": "MAPK phosphatase-1", "answer_start": 861}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What causes tuberculosis?", "id": 890, "answers": [{"text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "answer_start": 1889}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What percentage of the world has been infected by tuberculosis?", "id": 891, "answers": [{"text": "one third of the world's population", "answer_start": 1940}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many new tuberculosis cases are there each year worldwide?", "id": 892, "answers": [{"text": "9.2 million", "answer_start": 2089}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are some mitogen activated protein kinases?", "id": 893, "answers": [{"text": "extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)", "answer_start": 2639}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is MAPK activated?", "id": 894, "answers": [{"text": "phosphorylation", "answer_start": 3416}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What enzymes are involved with phosphorylation?", "id": 895, "answers": [{"text": "tyrosine phosphatases, serine/threonine phosphatases, and dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs)", "answer_start": 3672}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many MAPK phosphatases exist?", "id": 896, "answers": [{"text": "at least 10", "answer_start": 3858}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is lipopolysaccharide?", "id": 897, "answers": [{"text": "a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria", "answer_start": 4089}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is Staph aureus?", "id": 898, "answers": [{"text": "Gram positive bacteria", "answer_start": 5150}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What protein is in the critical path of immunity and cytokine expression?", "id": 899, "answers": [{"text": "MAPK", "answer_start": 7415}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "A novel anti-mycobacterial function of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804704/\n\nSHA: f6ed1f1e9999e57793addb1c9c54f61c7861a995\n\nAuthors: Cheung, Benny KW; Yim, Howard CH; Lee, Norris CM; Lau, Allan SY\nDate: 2009-12-17\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2172-10-64\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. To combat against this pathogen, immune cells release cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which is pivotal in the development of protective granulomas. Our previous results showed that Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), a mycobacterium used as a model to investigate the immune response against MTB, stimulates the induction of TNF-\u03b1 via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in human blood monocytes. Since MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is known to regulate MAPK activities, we examined whether MKP-1 plays a role in BCG-induced MAPK activation and cytokine expression. RESULTS: Primary human blood monocytes were treated with BCG and assayed for MKP-1 expression. Our results demonstrated that following exposure to BCG, there was an increase in the expression of MKP-1. Additionally, the induction of MKP-1 was regulated by p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Surprisingly, when MKP-1 expression was blocked by its specific siRNA, there was a significant decrease in the levels of phospho-MAPK (p38 MAPK and ERK1/2) and TNF-\u03b1 inducible by BCG. CONCLUSIONS: Since TNF-\u03b1 is pivotal in granuloma formation, the results indicated an unexpected positive function of MKP-1 against mycobacterial infection as opposed to its usual phosphatase activity.\n\nText: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, especially in the developing countries [1] . The disease is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and approximately one third of the world's population has been infected by this pathogen. In a recent report, World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there are 9.2 million new TB cases around the world in 2006 [1] .\n\nIn response to MTB infection, induction of cytokines by immune cells is an important defense mechanism. The infected macrophages secrete intercellular signaling factors, proinflammatory cytokines, to mediate the inflammatory response leading to the formation of granuloma and induction of T-cell mediated immunity [2] . In order to understand TB pathogenesis, signaling pathways induced by mycobacteria have long been a subject of interest. Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) have been implicated as important cellular signaling molecules activated by mycobacteria [3] . Previous reports have shown that p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 are required in the induction of TNF-\u03b1 expression in human monocytes infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv [4] . We have further revealed the significant role of MAPKs in the signal transduction events of mycobacterial activation of primary human blood monocytes (PBMo) leading to cytokine expressions via the interaction with PKR [5] . However, the subsequent events as to how MAPK is regulated and how such regulation affects cytokine production in response to mycobacteria remain to be elucidated.\n\nSince MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation, dephosphorylation of MAPKs seems to be an efficient process to inactivate their activities. It can be achieved by specific protein kinase phosphatases which can remove the phosphate group from MAPKs. Examples of these phosphatases include tyrosine phosphatases, serine/threonine phosphatases, and dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). Some DUSPs are also known as MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) [6] [7] [8] . Currently, there are at least 10 MKPs identified, while MKP-1 is the most studied member of the family. The regulatory role of MKP-1 on cytokine induction is best demonstrated by MKP-1 knockout (KO) macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. MKP-1 KO macrophages showed prolonged phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK as well as increased production of TNF-\u03b1 in response to LPS treatment [9] . Consistent with these results, another group further revealed that LPS-treated MKP-1 KO bone marrow-derived macrophages show increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity [10] . Also, they showed that LPS-induced MKP-1 expression is dependent on myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF) [10] , thus demonstrating the role of MKP-1 in signal transduction.\n\nNot only LPS, other TLR inducers including CpG, peptidoglycan, poly IC, and Pam 3 Cys can regulate cytokine expressions including TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 via MKP-1 activities [10, 11] . In these processes, MKP-1 serves to mitigate the undesirable effects of septic shock and maintain organ functions by restraining the inflammatory responses following bacterial infection. Another example of MKP-1 function is the immune response to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a Gram positive bacteria. There are higher levels of cytokine production including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MIP-1\u03b1 in MKP-1 KO mice infected with S. aureus [12] . Also, the mice would have a rapid development of multiorgan dysfunction as well as faster mortality rate upon challenge with heat-killed S. aureus [12] . Taken together, these results suggest that MKP-1 protects the host from overactivation of the immune system in response to Gram negative or Gram positive bacteria.\n\nIn the past, it was believed that different MKP/DUSP family members have overlapping functions. However, the emergence of DUSP2 turned the concept up side down [13] . It was shown that DUSP2 behaves differently and is opposite to the function as stated above. In DUSP2 KO cells, they produced less inflammatory mediators, implying that DUSP2 may play a role in mediating instead of limiting inflammation. For instances, when DUSP2 KO macrophages were treated with LPS, there were less TNF, IL-6, nitric oxide, IL-12-producing cells when compared to those of the wild type counterparts [13] . When the DUSP2 KO bone marrow-derived mast cells were first sensitized with immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor (Fc\u03b5RI) and then stimulated with dinitrophenol-heat stable antigen, they produced lower TNF mRNA levels, diminished IL-6 production, less phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and less transcriptional activities by Elk1 and NFAT-AP-1 [13] .\n\nThese unexpected positive regulations of immune cell functions by DUSP2 have been hypothesized to be due to crosstalks between MAPKs [13] . Stimulation of KO mast cells and macrophages showed increases in phosphorylation of JNK. Moreover, inhibition of JNK by small molecule inhibitors showed increases in phosphorylation of ERK [13] . The authors also showed that there were physical interactions of DUSP2 with ERK2, DUSP2 with JNK2, as well as DUSP2 and p38 MAPK after stimulation of the cells with dinitrophenol-heat stable antigen. Nevertheless, the details of the crosstalks between MAPKs and phosphatases need further investigation. Thus, the MKP family plays a critical role in the regulation of immune responses.\n\nInnate immune response protects the host from MTB infection by secretion of cytokines including TNF-\u03b1 in immune cells. Meanwhile, MAPK is one of the critical proteins in the regulation of immunity and cytokine expression. Since MAPK is regulated by MKP-1 in response to LPS and the activation of MAPK is important in BCGinduced cytokine expression, we hypothesize that MKP-1 plays a critical role in the immune regulation of BCG in human monocytes. We examined the involvement of MKP-1 in BCG-induced MAPK activation and its consequent cytokine expression. Here, we present evidences that MKP-1 plays an unexpected role in the regulation of cytokine induction by BCG through its control of MAPK phosphorylation.\n\nIt has been reported that many inducers including growth factors, LPS, peptidoglycan, and dexamethasone can stimulate the expression of MKP-1 in human macrophages, microglia, mast cells or fibroblasts [6] . To investigate the role of different TLR inducers in MKP-1 induction process in human blood monocytes, the level of MKP-1 mRNA was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) method. PBMo were isolated from primary human blood mononuclear cells and stimulated with Pam 3 Cys (TLR2 agonist), poly IC (TLR3 agonist), or LPS (TLR4 agonist) for 1 and 3 hours. Following exposure to Pam 3 Cys or LPS, there were significant inductions of MKP-1 mRNA levels within 1 hour of treatment ( Figure  1A ). These effects on MKP-1 induction continued for 3 hours post-treatment with Pam 3 Cys ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, poly IC did not induce MKP-1 ( Figure 1A ). The results indicate that different inducers showed differential up-regulation of MKP-1 expression.\n\nLPS has been extensively used to demonstrate the role of MKP-1 in immune response both in vivo and in vitro [9, 12] . To establish a foundation for interpretation of subsequent experimental results, LPS was used as a positive control for the induction of MKP-1 expression. To determine the levels of MKP-1 in response to LPS, kinetics of MKP-1 transcription were determined by QPCR. There was a significant induction of MKP-1 mRNA, which peaked as early as 1 hour upon LPS stimulation, and the levels gradually decreased over a course of 6 hours. These results showed that LPS induced MKP-1 expression (Figure 1B) .\n\nNext, to demonstrate the induction of specific phosphatases by BCG, kinetics of MKP-1 expression in PBMo was studied by using QPCR during BCG treatment. Similar to the results produced by LPS, upon the addition of BCG (MOI = 1 CFU/cell), there was a significant induction of MKP-1 mRNA within 1 hour of BCG treatment as determined by Taqman probe specific for MKP-1 ( Figure  2A ). The effects lasted for at least 6 hours ( Figure 2A ).\n\nTo examine whether the changes of protein production were in parallel to that of the mRNA levels, the protein levels of MKP-1 were measured by Western blotting. In response to BCG, PBMo produced the MKP-1 protein as early as 30 minutes after treatment. The protein levels were maintained for 2 hours and dropped to basal levels at 3 hours ( Figure 2B ). The results demonstrated that there was MKP-1 induction in response to BCG activation in human monocytes.\n\nIt has been shown that inhibition of p38 MAPK either by specific inhibitor or siRNA reduced the expression of MKP-1 in LPS-or peptidoglycan-treated macrophages [14] . To determine the mechanisms involved in the BCGinduced MKP-1 expression, PBMo were pretreated with several inhibitors including PD98059 (inhibitor for MAP kinase kinase [MEK] or ERK1/2), SB203580 (inhibitor for p38 MAPK), SP600125 (inhibitor for JNK), and CAPE (inhibitor for NF-\u03baB) for 1 hour. A range of concentrations of each inhibitor was used to test their optimal concentrations and effects on cell viability and kinase inhibitions. BCG was added afterwards and total RNA was harvested. The results demonstrated that, with the inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activities by their corresponding relatively specific inhibitors, MKP-1 expressions were significantly reduced ( Figure 3 ). In addition, using higher dose of SB203580, we showed that the inhibition is increased further (data not shown). On the contrary, pretreatment of the cells with CAPE and SP600125 did not affect the induction of MKP-1 by BCG ( Figure 3 ). These results suggest that BCG-induced MKP-1 expression is dependent on both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. \n\nThroughout the above experiments, the primary goal was to examine the induction of MKP-1 by BCG in human monocytes. Thus, to further examine the role of MKP-1 in BCG-induced signaling, transfection of siRNA into PBMo was used to knockdown the activity of MKP-1. To demonstrate that the MKP-1 siRNA can indeed knockdown the target gene, PBMo were first transfected with control or MKP-1 siRNA and then treated with BCG for 3 hours. Levels of MKP-1 mRNA were measured by RT-PCR method.\n\nIn Figure 4A , BCG stimulated MKP-1 expression (lanes 1 and 2). In MKP-1 siRNA transfected monocytes, induction of MKP-1 by BCG was significantly decreased (lanes 2 and 4). The results showed that the siRNA does abrogate the levels of MKP-1 mRNA.\n\nTo further determine whether MKP-1 siRNA affects BCGinduced MKP-1 at protein levels, PBMo were treated as above and MKP-1 proteins were measured by Western blotting. The results showed that BCG could induce MKP-1 proteins as usual for cells transfected with control siRNA ( Figure 4B , lanes 1-3). However, the levels of BCGinduced MKP-1 protein expression were reduced in cells transfected with MKP-1 siRNA ( Figure 4B , lanes 4-6). Together, the results suggest that MKP-1 siRNA not only reduced the MKP-1 mRNA in BCG treatment but also abrogated the BCG-induced MKP-1 protein.\n\nAs stated in the literature [9] , MKP-1 KO mice showed increased TNF-\u03b1 production in response to LPS. On the basis of the above MKP-1 siRNA results, LPS was then used as a control to demonstrate the effects of this MKP-1 siRNA system. cytokine expression induced by LPS in MKP-1 siRNA transfected cells suggest that the siRNA system is effective in knocking down the MKP-1 expression and MKP-1 acts as a negative regulator in LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 expression.\n\nTo investigate the effect of MKP-1 siRNA on BCG-induced cytokine expression, the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA were measured by QPCR method. PBMo were transfected with either control or MKP-1 siRNA. Following exposure to BCG with control siRNA, there were significant inductions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA levels for 3 hours after treatment as previously reported ( [5] and data not shown). Next, the effects of MKP-1 siRNA were examined on the cytokine expression induced by BCG. Surprisingly, there was a significant abrogation of BCGinduced TNF-\u03b1 expression by MKP-1 siRNA ( Figure 4D ). With the knockdown of MKP-1, the level of BCG-induced TNF-\u03b1 was only 60% compared to that of the control cells, while BCG-induced IL-6 and IL-10 were unchanged in MKP-1 siRNA transfected cells. The results revealed that MKP-1 plays a role in the induction of TNF-\u03b1 expression upon BCG stimulation, which may be different from that of its conventional functions in which MKP-1 acts as a negative regulator in LPS-induced signaling pathways [7] .\n\nThe unexpected observations in cytokine expression lead to the investigation on the effects of MKP-1 siRNA on BCG-induced MAPK activation. MKP-1 was found to have a preferential substrate binding to p38 MAPK and JNK than ERK1/2 [7] . The phosphorylation status of MAPKs was assessed in control or MKP-1 siRNA transfected PBMo. Western blotting results demonstrated that BCGinduced both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 15 minutes (data not shown) and peaked at 30 minutes, and then returned to basal levels in cells treated with the control siRNA ( Figure 5 ). Similar to the results of cytokine expression, phosphorylation of both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in response to BCG was decreased in monocytes transfected with MKP-1 siRNA instead of the expected increase in phosphorylation ( Figure 5 ). The results suggest that MKP-1 knockdown would result in reduced MAPK phosphorylation by BCG, implying that the reduced level of TNF-\u03b1 production in BCG stimulated monocytes is due to reduced phosphorylation of MAPKs by MKP-1 siRNA.\n\nThis report presented evidences that a novel function of MKP-1 is uncovered in cytokine regulation in response to mycobacterial infection. BCG induces MKP-1 as a rapid response (Figure 2) . The induction mechanism of MKP-1 by BCG is dependent on both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK ( Figure 3 ). Using siRNA approach, the functions of MKP-1 can be examined in primary human monocytes. The results showed that the BCG-induced MAPKs activation as well as cytokine expression are downstream of MKP-1 ( Figures 4D and 5) . Thus, MKP-1 is a critical signaling molecule that is involved in BCG-induced cytokine expression.\n\nPrevious reports have shown that MKP-1 induced by LPS or peptidoglycan is dependent on p38 MAPK [14] . Accordingly, BCG-induced MKP-1 can be inhibited by both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 inhibitors. Interestingly, it has been shown that degradation of MKP-1 is reduced after ERK1/2 phosphorylation [15] . It can be hypothesized that BCG-induced MKP-1 proteins can be stabilized by ERK1/2 and the detailed mechanisms involved require more exploration. Also, since the inhibition of MKP-1 expression by both inhibitors (for p38 MAPK and ERK1/ 2) was not complete, it is believed that other proteins may be involved in the BCG-induced MKP-1 expression.\n\nOn the basis of the literature results on LPS effects ( Figure  6 ), the original expectation for this project is that MKP-1 acts as a negative regulator. LPS-stimulated MKP-1 KO peritoneal macrophages showed prolonged phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK as well as increased production of TNF-\u03b1 [9] . In doing so, LPS-induced MKP-1 could BCG-induced MAPK phosphorylation is decreased by MKP-1 siRNA prevent prolonged TNF-\u03b1 production as in sepsis which may lead to severe damage to the host. It was expected that BCG induces MKP-1 and its induction would correlate with the dephosphorylation of MAPKs including p38 MAPK. By blocking the MKP-1 using siRNA, it was expected to have increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation and prolonged TNF-\u03b1 production in response to BCG. Nevertheless, our results shown here are diametrically opposite. One possibility for the unexpected results may be due to non-specific effects of transfection or siRNA. However, this was not the case since there was a prolonged and increased TNF-\u03b1 expression after the MKP-1 siRNA-transfected monocytes were treated with LPS (Figure 4C ).\n\nThere is now a new hypothesis to explain such paradoxical effects of MKP-1 in TNF-\u03b1 regulation in which the phosphatase plays a role in positive regulation of TNF-\u03b1 production in response to BCG as in the case of DUSP2 [13] . The structures of MKP-1 and DUSP2 are similar, with which they both contain a MAPK-interacting domain and a phosphatase catalytic site. By contrast, other DUSP may have extra domains, e.g., PEST [6] . Here, we postulate that the function of MKP-1 in BCG-induced signaling is similar to that of the DUSP2/PAC1.\n\nActually, the discovery of DUSP2 has initially created some paradoxical questions. As described, DUSP2 behaves differently from other MKP family members [13] . In DUSP2 KO macrophages treated with LPS, they produced less inflammatory mediators including less TNF, IL-6, nitric oxide, and IL-12-producing cells, when compared to that of the wild type counterparts [13] . Indeed, the results of these published studies on DUSP2 studies are quite similar to that of our reported results here.\n\nIt is plausible that these unexpected positive regulations of immune cell functions by DUSP2 were due to crosstalks between MAPKs [13] . It was shown that there are interactions between JNK and ERK1/2 pathways [16] .\n\nHere, we showed that the sustained activation of JNK blocks ERK activation ( Figure 6 ). In the DUSP2 situation, stimulation of KO mast cells and macrophages shows increased phosphorylation of JNK, and inhibition of JNK by its own specific inhibitor restores phosphorylation of ERK1/2 [13] .\n\nIn the BCG-MKP-1 situation, there is an early phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. Therefore, it is possible that JNK may play a role in the crosstalk interaction of MAPK. However, our preliminary data suggest that the level of phosphorylated JNK was not increased in PBMo MKP-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cytokine expression upon mycobacterial infection Figure 6 MKP-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cytokine expression upon mycobacterial infection. LPS model was provided according to literature findings (Left). In this scenario, LPS activates MKP-1, which in turn dephosphorylates and deactivates phospho-p38 MAPK, resulting in less TNF-\u03b1 induction. However, the situation in DHP-HSA activation of DUSP2 is more complicated (Middle), since the phosphatase activity causes subsequent inhibition of phospho-JNK which leads to the derepression of phospho-p38 MAPK. Consequently, the combined effects of this cascade results in more TNF-\u03b1 expression. The unexpected antimycobacterial role of MKP-1 (Right) may be explained by events similar to the DUSP2 effects. In this case (Right), there was an inhibition of unknown pathways or kinases downstream of MKP-1, and the unknown factor in turn inhibits MAPKs activation leading to more TNF-\u03b1 induction. The details and kinase targets are yet to be identified. transfected with MKP-1 siRNA (data not shown). Thus, the details of the crosstalk between MAPKs need further investigation. Here, we present a model to summarize the results and to hypothesize the existence of an as yet unidentified intermediary factor or factors in the pathways downstream of MKP-1 effects in the BCG-induced signaling cascade. The unexpected antimycobacterial role of MKP-1 ( Figure 6 ) may be explained by events similar to the DUSP2 effects. In this case, BCG induces MKP-1 expression while also activates MAPKs including p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. Downstream of MKP-1, there is an inhibition of unknown pathways or kinases. The unknown factor in turn inhibits MAPKs activation, which ultimately leads to more TNF-\u03b1 induction ( Figure 6 ).\n\nIn summary, MKP-1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cytokine expression upon mycobacterial infection. Inhibition of unknown pathways or kinases downstream of MKP-1, which in turn inhibits MAPKs activation, may be used to explain the novel function of MKP-1 in enhancing MAPK activity and consequent TNF-\u03b1 expression following BCG treatment ( Figure 6 ). Taken together, the role of MAPK crosstalks need further exploration. (3) TNF-\u03b1, 30 cycles (TM = 56\u00b0C), upstream, 5'-GGCTCCAGGCGGTGCTTGTTC-3', downstream, 5'-AGACGGCGATGCGGCTGATG-3'. PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light. In order to check the size of the PCR products, 1 kb Plus DNA Lad-der\u2122 (Invitrogen, USA) was run along with the PCR products.\n\nTo perform QPCR, the levels of MKP-1, and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA as well as the reference gene GAPDH (as internal control) were assayed by the gene-specific Assays-on-Demand reagent kits (Applied Biosystems, USA). All samples were run in duplicates or triplicates and with no template controls on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector. The analysis method of QPCR was the comparative cycle number to threshold (C T ) method as described in user bulletin no. 2 of the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System. The number of C T of the targeted genes was normalized to that of GAPDH in each sample (\u0394C T ). The C T value of the treated cells was compared with that of the untreated or mock-treated cells (\u0394\u0394CT). The relative gene expression of the targeted genes (fold induction) was calculated as 2 -\u0394\u0394CT .\n\nTotal cellular proteins were extracted by lysing cells in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml PMSF, 1 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 \u03bcg/ml pepstatin, 2 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, and 50 mM sodium fluoride for 5 minutes. The homogenate was then boiled for 10 minutes and stored at -70\u00b0C until use. The concentrations of total protein in cell extracts were determined by BCA\u2122 Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, IL, USA).\n\nWestern blot was done as described [20] . Equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and followed by probing with specific antibod-ies for Actin, MKP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotech., USA), phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, USA). After three washes, the membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies. The bands were detected using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nTransfection of siRNA into human monocytes was done as described [21] . MKP-1 siRNA included (i) MKP1-HSS102982, AAACGCUUCGUAUCCUCCUUUGAGG; (ii) MKP1-HSS102983, UUAUGCCCAAGGCAUCCAG-CAUGUC; and (iii) MKP1-HSS102984, UGAUG-GAGUCUAUGAAGUCAAUGGC. MKP-1 knockdown in PBMo was conducted by using MKP1-HSS102983 only or a pool of the above three different MKP-1 Stealth\u2122 Select RNAi (ratio = 1:1:1, 200 nM, Invitrogen, USA). Stealth\u2122 RNAi Negative Control Duplex (200 nM) was used as a control for sequence independent effects for the siRNA transfection. Transfection of monocytes was done by using jetPEI\u2122 DNA transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfecting the cells for 24 h, the transfectants were treated with different inducers as described above.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed by Student's t test.

It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral\u2013fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.\n\nText: Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. A human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Most recently, an SARS-related CoV was implicated as the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak in Wuhan, central China. This outbreak is estimated to have started on 12th December 2019 and 17,332 laboratory confirmed cases with 361 deaths as of 3rd February 2020 in China [1] . The virus has spread to 23 other countries by travellers from Wuhan [1] . Typical symptoms are fever, malaise, shortness of breath and in severe cases, pneumonia [2] [3] [4] . The disease was first called unidentified viral pneumonia.\n\nWe quickly identified the etiological agent, termed 2019-nCoV (virus name designated by the World Health Organization). The newly identified virus is an SARS-related virus (SARSr-CoV) but shares only 74.5% genome identity to SARS-CoV [2] . We developed molecular detection tools based on viral spike genes. Our previous studies indicate that qPCR method can be used for the detection of 2019-nCoV in oral swabs or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) [5] .\n\nAdditionally, we developed IgM and IgG detection methods using a cross-reactive nucleocapsid protein (NP) from another SARSr-CoV Rp3 [6] , which is 92% identical to 2019-nCoV NP. Using these serological tools, we demonstrate viral antibody titres increase in patients infected with 2019-nCoV [5] .\n\nLike SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV induced pneumonia through respiratory tract by clinical observation. Therefore, the presence of viral antigen in oral swabs was used as detection standard for 2019-nCoV. Similarly, two times of oral swabs negative in a 24-h interval was considered as viral clearance by patients officially.\n\nHere we launched an investigation of 2019-nCoV in a Wuhan hospital, aiming to investigate the other possible transmission route of this virus.\n\nHuman samples, including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood samples were collected by Wuhan pulmonary hospital with the consent from all patients and approved by the ethics committee of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Two investigations were performed. In the first investigation, we collected samples from 39 patients, 7 of which were in severe conditions. In the second investigation, we collected samples from 139 patients, yet their clinical records were not available. We only showed patients who were viral nucleotide detection positive. Patients were sampled without gender or age preference unless where indicated. For swabs, 1.5 ml DMEM+2% FBS medium was added in each tube. Supernatant was collected after 2500 rpm, 60 s vortex and 15-30 min standing. Supernatant from swabs were added to lysis buffer for RNA extraction. Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 g for 15 min within 24 h of collection, followed by 56\u00b0C 30 min inactivation, and then stored at 4\u00b0C until use.\n\nWhenever commercial kits were used, manufacturer's instructions were followed without modification. RNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcl of samples with the High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche). RNA was eluted in 50 \u03bcl of elution buffer and used as the template for RT-PCR. QPCR detection method based on 2019-nCoV S gene can be found in the previous study [5] . In brief, RNA extracted from above used in qPCR by HiScript\u00ae II One Step qRT-PCR SYBR\u00ae Green Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd). The 20 \u03bcl qPCR reaction mix contained 10 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 One Step SYBR Green Mix, 1 \u03bcl One Step SYBR Green Enzyme Mix, 0.4 \u03bcl 50 \u00d7 ROX Reference Dye 1, 0.4 \u03bcl of each primer (10 \u03bcM) and 2 \u03bcl template RNA. Amplification was performed as follows: 50\u00b0C for 3 min, 95\u00b0C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and a default melting curve step in an ABI 7500 machine.\n\nIn-house anti-SARSr-CoV IgG and IgM ELISA kits were developed using SARSr-CoV Rp3 NP as antigen, which shared above 90% amino acid identity to all SARSr-CoVs, as reported previously [5] . For IgG test, MaxiSorp Nunc-immuno 96 well ELISA plates were coated (100 ng/well) overnight with recombinant NP. Human sera were used at 1:20 dilution for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. An anti-Human IgG-HRP conjugated monoclonal antibody (Kyab Biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) was used at a dilution of 1:40,000. The OD value (450-630) was calculated. For IgM test, Maxi-Sorp Nunc-immuno 96 wellELISA plates were coated (500 ng/well) overnight with anti-human IgM (\u00b5 chain). Human sera were used at 1:100 dilution for 40 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by anti-Rp3 NP-HRP conjugated (Kyab Biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) at a dilution of 1:4000. The OD value (450-630) was calculated.\n\nIn the first investigation, we aimed to test whether viral positive can be found in anal swab and blood as well as oral swabs. We conducted a molecular investigation to patients in Wuhan pulmonary hospital, who were detected as oral swabs positive for 2019-nCoV upon admission. We collected blood, oral swabs and anal swabs for 2019-nCoV qPCR test using previously established method [5] .\n\nWe found 15 patients who still carry virus following days of medical treatments. Of these patients, 8 were oral swabs positive (53.3%), 4 were anal swabs positive (26.7%), 6 blood positives (40%) and 3 serum positives (20%). Two patients were positive by both oral swab and anal swab, yet none of the blood positive was also swabs positive. Not surprisingly, all serum positives were also whole serum positive (Table 1 ). In summary, viral nucleotide can be found in anal swab or blood even if it cannot be detected in oral swabs. It should be noted that although swabs may be negative, the patient might still be viremic.\n\nWe then did another investigation to find out the dynamic changes of viral presence in two consecutive studies in both oral and anal swabs in another group of patients. The target patients were those who received around 10 days of medical treatments upon admission. We tested for both viral antibody and viral nucleotide levels by previously established method [5] . We showed that both IgM and IgG titres were relatively low or undetectable in day 0 (the day of first sampling). On day 5, an increase of viral antibodies can be seen in nearly all patients, which was normally considered as a transition from earlier to later period of infection ( Figure 1 and supplementary table 1 ). IgM positive rate increased from 50% (8/16) to 81% (13/16), whereas IgG positive rate increased from 81% (13/16) to 100% (16/16). This is in contrast to a relatively low detection positive rate from molecular test (below). For molecular detection, we found 8 oral swabs positive (50%) and 4 anal swabs (25%) in these 16 people on day 0. On day 5, we were only able to find 4 oral swabs positive (25%). In contrast, we found 6 anal swabs positive (37.5%). When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%). Another observation is the reoccurrence of virus in 6 patients who were detected negative on day 0. Of note, 4 of these 6 viral positives were from anal swabs ( Table 2) . These data suggested a shift from more oral positive during early period (as indicated by antibody titres) to more anal positive during later period might happen.\n\nWithin 1 month of the 2019-nCoV disease outbreak, we rapidly developed molecular and serological detection tools. This is the first molecular and serological study on this virus after the initial identification of 2019-NCoV from 7 patients diagnosed with unidentified viral pneumonia [5] . We detected the virus in oral swabs, anal swabs and blood, thus infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory, fecal-oral or body fluid routes. In addition, we successfully applied serology test a large population and showed which could greatly improved detection positive rate.\n\nWe show that the current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019-nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative. In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients, intestinal infection was observed at later stages of infection [7] [8] [9] . However, patients infected with 2019-nCoV may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease. It is also worth to note none of the patients with viremia blood had positive swabs. These patients would likely be considered as 2019-nCoV negative through routine surveillance, and thus pose a threat to other people. In contrast, we found viral antibodies in near all patients, indicating serology should be considered for 2019-nCoV epidemiology. A possible shift from oral positive during early infection to anal swab positive during late infection can be observed. This observation implied that we cannot discharge a patient purely based on oral swabs negative, who may still shed the virus by oral-fecal route. Above all, we strongly suggest using viral IgM and IgG serological test to confirm an infection, considering the unreliable results from oral swabs detection.\n\nIn summary, we provide a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be transmitted through multiple routes. Both molecular and serological tests are needed to definitively confirm a virus carrier.", "document_id": 2653}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why might we underestimate the spread of COVID19?", "id": 2185, "answers": [{"text": "limited information available regarding incubation time, transmissibility, and virus origin", "answer_start": 3118}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was the first imported case of COVID19 in the United States?\n", "id": 2186, "answers": [{"text": "Washington", "answer_start": 4564}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the first case of COVID19 confirmed in the USA?", "id": 2187, "answers": [{"text": "January 15, 2020", "answer_start": 4421}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the second COVID19 case reported in the US?", "id": 2188, "answers": [{"text": "January 24, 2020", "answer_start": 4723}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was the second reported case of COVID in the United States?", "id": 2189, "answers": [{"text": "Chicago", "answer_start": 4667}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the first local transmission of COVID reported in the United States?", "id": 2190, "answers": [{"text": "January 30, 2020", "answer_start": 4929}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the WHO declare COVID to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern?", "id": 2191, "answers": [{"text": "January 30, 2020", "answer_start": 4929}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the United States declare COVID19 a public health emergency?", "id": 2192, "answers": [{"text": "January 31, 2020,", "answer_start": 5172}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the most common symptoms of COVID19?", "id": 2193, "answers": [{"text": "Fever and cough ", "answer_start": 6790}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What symptoms might people experience with COVID19?", "id": 2194, "answers": [{"text": "patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly", "answer_start": 7166}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who is at greater risk of dying from COVID19?", "id": 2195, "answers": [{"text": "patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly", "answer_start": 7166}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How long is the incubation time for COVID19?", "id": 2196, "answers": [{"text": "between 2 and 14 days", "answer_start": 7356}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How does COVID19 get spread?", "id": 2197, "answers": [{"text": "close contact with an infected person", "answer_start": 11444}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Is it possible to get infected with COVID and another virus?", "id": 2198, "answers": [{"text": "Although the likelihood of coinfection of 2019-nCoV and another respiratory virus is thought to be low, a positive finding of another respiratory pathogen does not exclude the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV", "answer_start": 14067}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "2019-nCoV: The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081861/\n\nSHA: f323af9a07cc54faf9bdbabadaacb0e8b46f99a2\n\nAuthors: Koenig, Kristi L.; Be\u00ff, Christian K.; McDonald, Eric C.\nDate: 2020-01-31\nDOI: 10.5811/westjem.2020.1.46760\nLicense: cc-by\n\nAbstract: 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging infectious disease closely related to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV that was first reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 3I Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.\n\nText: 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a novel respiratory disease first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. 1 Chinese health officials were originally investigating a sudden increase in cases of pneumonia which were later determined to be linked to 2019-nCoV. While most cases originated within mainland China, the disease spread to neighboring countries including Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, and Japan, and later to the United States, Europe, and Australia. A near real-time updated tracking website for cases and locations worldwide, along with reported deaths is available. 2 Chinese health authorities have sequenced 2019-nCoV and freely shared its genetic profile online. 3, 4 Additionally, on January 28, 2020, an Australian laboratory reported growing the virus from a patient sample. As of January 30, 2020, there have been at least 9,776 persons infected and 213 verified deaths. 2 These numbers are likely underestimates due to the limited information available regarding incubation time, transmissibility, and virus origin. The What was the research question? Investigators adapted the \"Identify, Isolate, Inform\" (3I) Tool for use in suspected cases of 2019-nCoV.\n\nWhat was the major finding of the study? A novel 2019-nCoV 3I Tool is designed for frontline clinicians in the management of suspected patients.\n\nThis 2019-nCoV 3I adaptation will aid healthcare providers most likely to encounter the disease in the containment and effective treatment of patients.\n\nage distribution of these verified deaths is currently not available.\n\nOne preliminary, small-scale study of 41 patients in Wuhan China, reported 6 deaths (15% mortality) with a median age of 49.0 years. 5 Additionally, transmission of the virus has reportedly occurred in healthcare facilities in Wuhan City, raising concerns of spread to healthcare workers, as was seen during prior outbreaks of the novel coronaviruses, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Due to the dynamic nature of the outbreak, exposure criteria may change depending on where new cases of 2019-nCoV are detected, the degree of transmissibility, and when additional information regarding the origin of the virus is discovered and reported. On January 15, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first known imported case of 2019-nCoV in the US state of Washington. The patient had recently returned from Wuhan City, where he likely contracted the disease. Chicago health authorities reported a second US case on January 24, 2020. This was quickly followed by additional imported cases reported in Orange and Los Angeles Counties, California on January 26, 2020. Additional suspected cases continue to be evaluated. On January 30, 2020, the CDC reported the first local transmission in the US between members in a household. On the same day, the World Health Organization declared 2019-nCoV to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 6 On January 31, 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services declared coronavirus a public health emergency. 7 Healthy individuals and those with mild illness may be asymptomatic, while others may have more pronounced symptoms of fever or lower respiratory illness. Upon identification of a suspected patient, that individual should immediately be isolated with airborne precautions. Further workup and laboratory confirmation can then proceed. Emergency physicians (EPs), emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, and other healthcare workers who encounter patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection must inform the appropriate authorities, including but not limited to hospital infection control and local or state public health agencies.\n\nHealthcare workers must follow on-going developments related to the outbreak, especially new information concerning detection and management. 8, 9 The 3I Tool outlined in this paper is consistent with current US CDC guidelines and can be applied in a variety of settings such as those in emergency departments, urgent-care clinics, physicians' offices, and prehospital settings. This paper will first briefly review 2019-nCoV and then present the novel 2019-nCoV 3I Tool as modified from its initial conception for Ebola virus disease 10,11 and later adapted for measles, 12 MERS, 13 mumps, 14 Zika virus disease, 15 hepatitis A, 16 pertussis, 17 and scabies. 18 \n\nCoronavirus 2019-nCoV infection commonly presents with signs and symptoms of pneumonia or as a nonspecific lower respiratory illness, with coughing or difficulty breathing accompanied by fever. 5, 19, 20 Fever and cough constitute the most common presentations. However, patients may have other respiratory symptoms, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, myalgia, and headache. Bilateral infiltrates may be seen on chest X-ray. Severe cases may present with sepsis and even shock. Conversely, some patients may present as only mildly ill or asymptomatic altogether. 21 To date, patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly are more likely to become severely ill, require hospitalization, and ultimately die. 22 Early predictions for incubation time are between 2 and 14 days, based on data from similar coronaviruses. The 14-day criterion for epidemiological risk assumes the longest estimated incubation time. 23 In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) has created its own interim case definition. 24\n\nBy definition, the main features of a novel virus, for example, how it is transmitted, will not be immediately known. However, as with the development of any 3I Tool, it is essential to understand specific characteristics of the disease. In the case of a novel virus such as 2019-CoV, this is challenging since information is rapidly evolving and the science is not yet fully understood. It is possible that the virus will undergo mutations over time that could substantially change its\n\nThe Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus Koenig et al. features. Nevertheless, an appreciation of the key concepts that drive evidence-based management is beneficial (Table 1) . Management guidance will likely change over time.\n\nWith the initial discovery of a new potential public health threat, it will likely be unclear how patients become sick. For example, rather than a contagion, there could be a contaminant or a toxin responsible for signs and symptoms. In this case, the possibility of an environmental toxin in the Wuhan Market was a consideration early on when limited to no human-tohuman transmission was reported. The mode of transmission has implications for the types of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to protect healthcare providers in the prehospital, clinic, and hospital settings. 25 In addition, patients may need decontamination after exposure to certain toxins. 26 Another important consideration for application of the 3I Tool is whether the disease is contagious prior to symptom onset (like measles) or only after symptoms develop (like Ebola). A January 30, 2020 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine describes a purported confirmed instance of transmission from an asymptomatic individual. Researchers state that, before symptom onset, the primary case infected two individuals, one of which infected two additional colleagues. 27 Subsequent investigation suggested that the source patient did have mild symptoms and had taken an antipyretic, calling this reported asymptomatic transmission into question.\n\nWhile quarantine may not be feasible and can have unintended consequences, 28, 29, 30 it is a public health tool that can be considered in cases when disease is transmissible before symptom onset. 30 Conversely, if a disease is known not to be transmissible prior to symptom onset, asymptomatic exposed patients must be monitored, but do not require quarantine or isolation unless they develop symptoms.\n\nInitially, it may be unclear whether an infectious agent occurred naturally or was deliberately or accidentally released. In this case, a BSL-4 laboratory studying coronaviruses was located approximately 32 kilometers away from the market where initial exposures were felt to occur. 31 Recall that in 2001, the anthrax letter attacks were initially thought to be naturally occurring. Once determined to be bioterrorism, management of the event was similar to that for a chemical exposure with a sudden impact, defined scene, and need for a rapid response and decontamination on site. This differed from the WHO's modeling predicting an aerosolized release that would result in an incubation period with 100,000 or more persons exposed rather than the 22 people who contracted anthrax in 2001. 32 By understanding the key features of a novel disease, healthcare workers can take evidence-based measures to protect themselves, optimize individual patient management, and prevent further disease spread.\n\nIt is currently unclear how 2019-nCoV is spread, but it is suspected to be transmitted through contact with infected respiratory secretions, like other known coronaviruses. There are instances of sustained human-to-human transmission across generations of cases, especially near the epicenter in Wuhan City. 21 Current evidence suggests that close contact with an infected person is a major factor in disease transmission. CDC defines \"close contact\" 33 as being in or within two meters of an area with a confirmed patient or being directly exposed to infectious secretions without appropriate PPE. Healthcare facilities in China have reported spread from person to person. In addition, some mildly ill or potentially even asymptomatic patients may have a higher chance of spreading the disease to others as they may be less likely to seek medical care. 34 The possibility that patients may be infectious prior to symptom onset further compounds the difficulty of containing the virus and effectively preventing transmission.\n\nThe current majority of 2019-nCoV cases have been within China and its bordering countries. 2 Persons with recent travel (within 14 days) to Wuhan City or another region with widespread disease, or exposure to a patient under investigation, are considered to have an epidemiologic risk factor and should be assessed for signs and symptoms of a viral illness such as fever and respiratory symptoms. Coronavirus is a zoonotic virus\n\nThe Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus that is transmitted to humans via contact with infected animals. Preliminary reports suggest the disease may have originated in a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan City, but it is still unknown how or whether such transmission occurred.\n\nClinicians working with local public health departments must arrange to have specimens from patients under investigation (PUIs) sent to the CDC laboratory. At this time, the CDC has the only laboratory that can definitively test for 2019-nCoV, though laboratory testing capacity is being rapidly expanded. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays conducted on samples from a patient's upper and lower respiratory tracts will be used to confirm potential cases. In addition, serum antibody titers can be analyzed for confirmation of infection or evidence of immunity. Up-to-date information about the needed specimens and handling requirements to test for 2019-nCoV are available on the CDC website. 35\n\nLike other related coronaviruses, patients with 2019-nCoV frequently present with non-specific symptoms resembling that of influenza. Physicians may consider differential diagnoses related to a wide variety of respiratory infections. In order to relate these symptoms to 2019-nCoV, it is imperative that the identification of a potential exposure event (epidemiologic risk factor) within 14 days of symptom onset is made so that a more focused work-up for 2019-nCoV can be completed. Although the likelihood of coinfection of 2019-nCoV and another respiratory virus is thought to be low, a positive finding of another respiratory pathogen does not exclude the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. Many commercially available respiratory panels include \"coronavirus\" in the results, but neither a positive nor a negative finding on these panels should be used to include or exclude a diagnosis of 2019-nCoV.\n\nSupportive care with appropriate infection control is the mainstay of current CDC treatment guidelines for 2019-nCoV. There are not yet any approved antiviral treatments for 2019-nCoV. Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for compassionate use cases may be forthcoming from the US federal government for normally unapproved treatments. Supportive treatment predominantly includes respiratory support, hydration, and antipyretics. General treatment for severe cases should focus on the preservation of vital organ function. In the future, antiviral medications may be available. If a secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia develops, targeted antibiotics are indicated.\n\nPrevention of 2019-nCoV transmission, like any other infectious agent, involves minimizing risk of exposure. Vaccines are under accelerated development and may be useful in the future for post-exposure prophylaxis. Healthcare personnel are at increased risk and should practice standard, droplet, and airborne precautions when encountering an infected person, a PUI, or any symptomatic close contacts. Healthcare workers handling specimens should also adhere to CDC guidelines and should not attempt to perform any virus isolation or characterization.\n\nFever screening has been implemented at numerous airports, including major international hubs within Asia and the US. The efficacy of this intervention is not well documented, however, as some infected persons may be afebrile and disease transmission might occur prior to symptom onset. 27 In addition, people can artificially lower their temperature readings, e.g., by applying ice to their foreheads.\n\nAs outlined above, admission criteria for 2019-nCoV are similar to that of other patients. If patients do not meet medical criteria for hospitalization, they may be discharged home with isolation precautions and continued observation. EPs must notify local public health authorities so appropriate monitoring and community protective measures can be instituted.\n\nThe Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool was initially developed for Ebola virus disease 10,11 and later adapted for measles, 12 MERS, 13 mumps, 14 Zika virus disease, 15 hepatitis A, 16 pertussis, 17 and scabies. 18 This novel tool for suspected 2019-nCoV patients ( Figure 1 ) provides frontline clinicians with a simple algorithm to manage an emerging disease. Identification of exposed patients with an epidemiologic risk factor within 14 days of symptom onset is a crucial first step. An automatic prompt in the electronic health record can be useful in assisting clinicians with early identification of patients at risk. Case definitions promulgated by the WHO 24 and CDC 33 provide useful comprehensive definitions that have been incorporated into the 3I Tool. The 2019-nCoV Tool provides an accurate, summarized algorithm to immediately, and effectively manage suspected patients until additional resources can be consulted.\n\nPatients who do not have an exposure risk or any symptoms may be triaged normally. However, before making patient contact, providers must first apply the Vital Sign Zero concept. 36 Vital Sign Zero is a preliminary, non-contact assessment (i.e., performed prior to touching a patient to take traditional vital signs) to first determine whether specific PPE is indicated before the examination commences. By taking the additional time to complete this assessment, risk of exposure and further transmission can be minimized. while in the treatment facility should be started and maintained to assist with the possibility of contact tracing. Following isolation, physicians should immediately inform the appropriate authorities. Patients who do not meet medical criteria for admission can be isolated at home during the evaluation phase. 37 Health department officials can help prevent transmission in isolated patients by providing in-home monitoring and implementing appropriate exposure-control measures.\n\nProviders in the prehospital setting who have a high likelihood of encountering 2019-nCoV patients, such as those near international ports of entry, should adhere to established exposure control guidelines. 38 Along with appropriate PPE, providers should also carry thermometers to quantify any fever. In the US, providers should contact the appropriate CDC quarantine station upon isolation of infected or suspected patients, especially those from Wuhan, China or other regions with widespread disease, who report symptoms in the last 14 days. As for other infectious diseases, assessing travel history is essential. Dispatch protocols have been instituted to facilitate identification of callers to 911 or the country-equivalent emergency number prior to prehospital personnel arrival. 39 In addition, CDC has promulgated EMS guidelines for prehospital PPE, transportation of PUIs, vehicle decontamination, and 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for 2019-nCoV. 40\n\n2019-nCoV is an emerging infectious disease with rapidly evolving features, the full scope of which will be defined over time. Prior outbreaks of coronaviruses can help inform needed actions in the short term to assist with both treatment of individual patients and prevention of global disease spread. This adaptation of the Identify-Isolate-Inform Tool serves as a resource for healthcare workers who need to make clear, rapid assessments when confronted with potential patients. The concise nature of the 2019-nCoV 3I Tool allows for the rapid and effective management of a novel disease by healthcare providers.", "document_id": 2668}]}]}
